      thetext: "Created attachment 526\n(Context) diff output to patch the java bufferclient directory relative to SVN version r8582\n\nThe original java code had 2 failure modes when the buffer disconnected unexpectedly.\n1) If the buffer disconnected when reading/writing a message on the socket then the java would freeze in an infinite loop as it did not detect this condition.\n2) If the buffer disconnected between reading/writing messages this would not be detected *until* reading/writing the next message resulting in the infinite loop mentioned in bug 1 above.\n3) The isconnected test would return true even if the remote end was actually disconnted as the socket was still connected.\n\nThe fixes to these issues are 2 fold:\n1) In the read/write message code there is an additional check for the number of characters read/written.  If this is <0 this indicates the remote end has disconnected and a IO exception is raised.\n2) In the isConnected test we additionally try to read a single character from the socket.  This will fail if the remote end has disconnected giving a reliable test for this condition.\n\nOther Enhancements:\n\n1) Added an auto-reconnect functionality.  If this flag is set then a disconnect detected before reading/writing a message will first try to automatically re-connect to the previous buffer information. \n2) Added array value event type constructors to BufferEvent\n3) Fixed byte-order issue with the use of the slice function.\n\n\n\n\nAttached are the diff's w.r.t. SVN version r8582"
