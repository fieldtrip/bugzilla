      thetext: "When very long trials are shown using ft_databrowser, one can zoom in on the time axis, which then creates segments of the trial.  Clicking on the < or > buttons for previous or next segment then progresses through the segments.  But then when one reaches the end of the segments within a trial (e.g. Trial 1/4, Segment 50/50 for a 'trial' of length 400 s viewing 8 s at a time), one is stuck and must zoom back out on the horizontal axis until there aren't segments anymore (e.g. Trial 1/4 and all 400 s are showing) in order to progress to the next trial (e.g. Trial 2/4) and then zoom in again on the horizontal axis to scroll through in time at reasonable-sized segments.   This becomes tiresome after awhile.   \n\nEnhancement suggestion is that the horizontal zoom is remembered, and the > button allows progression from Trial 1/4 Segment 50/50 to Trial 2/4 Segment 1/50.\n\nThank you,\nJohanna"
