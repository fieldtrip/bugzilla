Therefore, I suggest to move 'gray','white'... etc. labels into tissue-label, and remove the tissuename field.

          (In reply to comment #1)
          But being honest, I do not see where the assigned numbers (in tissuelabel) are getting used at all, because when I put the names of the tissues into tissue-label ('gray','white'...etc), the function (ft_prepare_mesh, ft_prepare_headmodel and ft_prepare_leadfield) output exactly the same structures as the output-structures of an input with the original tissuelabels ('101','102'...).

          So, this information (the numbers in tissuelabel) seem not to be used.

          P.s. I added also Johannes to this bug, maybe he has some comment on it.

        thetext: I removed the tissuename field in the output of prepare_mesh_hexahedral, and the field tissuelabel contains the tissue names now (r7603).
