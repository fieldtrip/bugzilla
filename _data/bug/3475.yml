          PROBLEM SIMULATION:

          elec.label = {'elec1','elec2','elec3','elec4','elec5'}';
          elec.elecpos(:,1) = [1 2 3 4 5];
          elec.elecpos(:,2) = [1 1 1 1 1];
          elec.elecpos(:,3) = [1 1 1 1 1];
          elec.chanpos = elec.elecpos;
          elec.unit = 'mm';

          ft_plot_sens(elec, 'label', 'on')

          ... results in no labels shown, or as experienced using real data, throws the following error:

          Error using builtin
          The data is degenerate in at least one dimension - ND set of points lying in (N+1)D space.

          Error in qhullmx

          Error in convhulln (line 64)
          [k,vv] = qhullmx(x', opt);

          Error in projecttri (line 57)
              tri = convhulln(pos);

          Error in ft_plot_sens (line 298)
              tri = projecttri(pos);


          POTENTIAL SOLUTION:
          reorganize lines 293-313 to be more robust somehow, e.g. skipping the attempt to triangulate? for convenience, the code is:

          if isempty(ori) && ~isempty(pos)
            if ~any(isnan(pos(:)))
              % determine orientations based on surface triangulation
              tri = projecttri(pos);
              ori = normals(pos, tri);
            else
              % determine orientations by fitting a sphere to the sensors
              try
                tmp = pos(~any(isnan(pos), 2),:); % remove rows that contain a nan
                center = fitsphere(tmp);
              catch
                center = [nan nan nan];
              end
              for i=1:size(pos,1)
                ori(i,:) = pos(i,:) - center;
                ori(i,:) = ori(i,:)/norm(ori(i,:));
              end
            end
          end

          Note the triangulation approach also won't work for electrode arrays smaller than 3.

          ft_plot_sens(elec, 'label', 'on');
          Error using delaunay
          At least three input points must be provided to define a triangular mesh.

          The most common set of electrodes is for scalp EEG, where the outward displacement from the scalp surface (= the electrode triangulation) works well.

          Plotting the labels on top of the electrodes is not very good.

          I propose that a try-catch is added to the code to deal with electrode sets for which a triangulation cannot be determined.

          note that I recently changed the triangulation from convex hull into delaunay

          https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/3335f5c2fd6f96f0bff18a851d0073846e21e744

          That results in an open (at the bottom) triangulation instead of a closed one, which means that the label-displacement for the lower line of electrodes is better.

          The consequence is also that the "degenerate" error does not show up any more. But the labels for the linear array still don't show.
