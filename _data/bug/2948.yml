          dear team,

          As you might have noticed (it was announced ~1 year back), google is discontinuing its googlecode service. Our page on google code now states at the top "Google Code will be turning read-only on August 25th". See
          https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/ReadOnlyTransition
          and
          http://google-opensource.blogspot.nl/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html

          I have been aware of this for quite some time, but August 25 is next week, which means we finally have to deal with it.

          We now sync (automatically) from our in-house svn server to googlecode and to github. The problems I see with googlecode stopping is
          1) we loose the mechanism to share our code with external people
          2) we loose a nice interface to search through the svn revisions

          Re 1: On the long run it is not a problem, since github provides an alternative. But on the shorter run it is a problem, since if we don't do anything, we will have a readonly copy on google code that is getting stale. Given the continued development, we have to encourage people to move away from googlecode.

          Re 2: I personally find the browsing through old code and revisions on github not nearly as clear as on googlecode. E.g. compare

          https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/list
          https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commits/master

          and

          https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=10607
          https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/f46eb29e9fe61de6e3c4dffda6e5ee242015e0de

          Also regarding 2, github does not provide an easy mapping on the SVN revision numbers that we use in-house.

        thetext: "(In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #0)\nRe 2) have you considers switching from github to bitbucket? it's a git/mercurial based repository system, and has a fairly clear and clean(design terminology for modern) user-interface, a nice side-by-side diff view, etc. It also has a built-in 'bugzilla' feature. I just do not like that the page is sometimes a bit sluggish, which is due to the fancyness (ajax/javascript stuff). \n\nIt's made by Atlassian, who has made other, extremely neat functions for unit/regression testing, code commenting and documentation, something similar to bugzilla.\n\nI'll send you some screen caps by mail (cause you can see code on them ^^)"

          I have a personal bitbucket account and have "been there" (in relation to HCP, where we use Atlassian) a few times, but don't know it that well. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look at it in more detail.

          PS Regretfully the BB fieldtrip account is already taken :-(

          hmm, one member, and page is field-trip.com and bb/field-trip is still available. Maybe you can convince him to hand the account over to you?

That team is represented at \n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/fieldtriptoolbox\n\nI have added a git repository, which is a copy of the one at github. I have reconfigured the existing post-commit-gitsync hook on our svn server to do the same thing with bitbucket as it is doing with github. I.e. following every commit, the svn repo gets synchronised with both. The official release fieldtrip repository at bitbucket is now at\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/fieldtriptoolbox/fieldtrip\n\nDocumentation on the fieldtrip wiki needs to be updated and we should check that it all runs smoothly. I believe this addresses my initial item 2. And if not, we can still look into other alternatives on top of this."
