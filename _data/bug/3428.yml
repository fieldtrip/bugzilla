          Hi,

          Trying to run ft_spike_maketrials, with self-imported data (from Spyking-Circus), I get the following error:

          Error using ft_spike_maketrials (line 126)
          cfg.hdr.TimeStampPerSample must be specified

          Now, in the function description no such field is mentioned, but TimeStampPerSecond is. The latter makes more sense to me. In fact, with a quick glance I do not see any more mention of a field TimeStampPerSample in the code.

          In fact, when dealing with samples, it is not clear why one would need to refer to timestamps at all, is already samplerate is given (another enforced cfg field).

          Cheers,
          Stephen

          I now better understand the timestamps vs samples vs time in NeuraLynx data, so please ignore those comments.

          However, the small fact remains that in the function TimeStampPerSample is not mentioned as a necessary field.

          Cheers,
          stephen
