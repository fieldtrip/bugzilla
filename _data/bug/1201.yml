        thetext: "This used to work fine half a year ago. Now, in the case of 'chan_freq_time' with nchan = 1, a neighbors-structure is necessary. This cannot be constructed when there is only one channel, ft_prepare_neighbor throws a 'no neighbors found' error. Ft_freqstatistics used to be able to handle empty neighborhood structures. \n\nIf I change the data to 'freq_time', ft_freqstatistics stills throws an error, it checks for the presence of a neighborhood structure. If this check is commented out, the function fails when selecting data, cause it still tries to select channels. What has happened here, is the dimord 'freq_time' no longer supported?"

          hm, sounds like I introduced that one, although I don't know why it does not work when there are no neighbours.

          Just to be sure, if data dimord does not contain 'chan', no neighbours should be required, right? That's an easy fix (by extending the if-statement in line 107).


          About the other stuff, JM restrucuted ft_freqstatistics in May, revision 3499. Probably something went wrong there and this option is not fully supported anymore. I would propose you copy the exact error message here or fix it yourself ;) I am only doing channel-clustering at the moment, so I have no clue what might go wrong

          Are you sure that freq_time worked in an earlier version? I cannot find any change that might have caused this to not work anymore. statistics_montecarlo and findclusters have not changed since a long time

          I kinda hacked my way through chan_freq_time now, but the problem is that findcluster explicitly expects a 3D matrix. I could add a dummy dimension to make it work - but before I do that I need feedback from codemaster RO ;)

          btw chan_freq_time should work now. I don't like the change though, but I couldn't think of a better way to include this. Could you check whether it works for you as well?

        thetext: I don't remember when it did actually. It worked fine when it was implicit though (only 1 channel in chan_freq_time, and no neighbours), which would be the same if cfg.avgoverchan = yes I think. All of the situations should be handled by the same code I assume. I assume it's just the requirement of neighbours when no neighbours are there.

          oh, the freq_time case has nothing to do with neighbours -  the code crashes in findclusters because it expects a 4D matrix, but without channels it is 3D (freq_time_rpt)

          Any chan_freq_time case should work again (neighbours are only required if nchannels > 1 or ~avgoverchan)

          hm strange, back then I was so sure that it should work... but I had problems with my repository anyway, so maybe committing didn't work or something.

          Anyway, for now I decided to add a dummy channel dimension in case the channel dimension is absent.

          60 $ svn ci ft_freqstatistics.m -m "bugfix-#1201- freqstatistics can handle single channel data wo channel dimension (again)"
          Sending        ft_freqstatistics.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 5099.

          And I commited a testscript using your two example scripts (which runs fine now)
          63 $ svn add test_ft_freqstatistics.m
          A         test_ft_freqstatistics.m
          jorhor@mentat301:~/FieldTrip/trunk/test
