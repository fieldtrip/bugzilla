        thetext: this was for an older FT version. The single trial avg is converted to a single raw trial and then processed. Previously this resulted in a single raw trial output, which was then converted back into timelock by the call to ft_timelockanalysis. Now it is already converted back to timeklock inside the megplanar function.
