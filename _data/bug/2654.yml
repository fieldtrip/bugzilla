          plot example with strangely scaled saggital plane

          Dear ft developers,
          we just updated our ft version this morning and encountered a strange issue when plotting with ft_sourceplot and using the ortho functionality.

          as you can see in the screenshot I appended the functional data in one of the three planes (this seems kind of random) is scaled strangely.
          in my example this did not happen, when i used cfg.location = 'min' (another strange thing...)

          we will for now just move back to the ft version before (i think that was from last week or so).

          as I saw that there were a couple of changes in ft_sourceplot, i figured, those who implemented them might be faster in spotting the underlying problem (also I can currently not make it my priority).

          best
          p

          Hi Philipp,

          A change that I recently made in ft_plot_slice affects the 3D position of the slice that is plotted with respect to an intersection of a (cortical) mesh. That is in https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=9710 and some of the commits just before it (it starts with 9706).

          I recall MATLAB inconsistencies (over versions and platforms) with regards to how something is displayed if it is plotted on exactly the same place in 3D space. Here the  anatomical slice and functional slice are in 3D space and you happen to be looking at them from a specific angle. Could you recreate the figure, toggle on the "3d rotate" option, and rotate the upper right subplot? That might reveal that the missing data is displayed just behind anatomical slice.

          It would help to have the data that you are plotting. Or (if that is too large) the *.fig file.

          best
          Robert

          Dear Robert,
          find the source structure here
          https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3970306/source.mat
          and the fig here
          https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3970306/source.fig


          by using

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method='ortho';
          cfg.funparameter='powspctrm_avg';
          cfg.funcolorlim = [-.1 .1];
          ft_sourceplot(cfg, source)


          i can recreate the problem on our linux server (running Matlab2012a)

          on my Mac (running Matlab2013a) I cannot recreate the issue... the image looks fine

          also on the linux server, others had the issue but it seemed to randomly affect different planes.

          I tried the rotating and did not find any points behind the anatomy.
          to me it still looks like a scaling thing and not an overlay issue (if you look at my original example you see that the cross-hair moved from one end of the blue blob to the other one)

          cheers
          philipp

          if I comment out this section in ft_plot_slice around line 234

          % if all(isnan(V(:)))
          %   % the projection plane lies completely outside the box spanned by the data
          % else
          %   % trim the edges of the projection plane
          %   [sel1, sel2] = tight(V);
          %   V  = V (sel1,sel2);
          %   Xi = Xi(sel1,sel2);
          %   Yi = Yi(sel1,sel2);
          %   Zi = Zi(sel1,sel2);
          % end

          it does display correctly. So it is not a 3D rendering problem, but an issue with the mask updating. I don't really understand yet how the functional data and mask relate...
