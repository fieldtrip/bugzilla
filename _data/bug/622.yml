          alternative function to ft_artifact_threshold.m

          it seems to me that in ft_artifact_threshold the amplitude rangeval is based on the minmax value accross all channels instead of calculating a peak-to-peak value per channel

          due to different offsets on different channels this may cause strange artefact findings

          attached you find a modified version of the function which serves as a replacement

          this function has 2 extra output parameters:
           - badTrials : vector list of all trials defined as bad
           - chnArtRate : number of BAD trials per channel divided by the total number of trials
