          CCing Roemer as he implemented the cfg.viewresult functionality of volumerealign. But I think most of Diego's issue is a misunderstanding in terms of what viewresult is displaying? The warnings are mostly low-level issues, presumably not specific to this pipeline, but ideally needs to be looked at to confirm.

For now Giani, I wont include this tutorial because things are still under construction. They use a bunch of deep electrodes (no grid so far) so no huge benefit."

        thetext: "The warnings are probably specific to the datasets, although the mm unit warning is very common I think. \n\nIn my experience with the color intensity of the realigned CT has an extremely skewed distribution. Do you see a difference if you slide both bars almost all the way down? That will effectively make it binary, and compare that to both sliders all the way up. The difference should be really noticeable. If this doesn't have any effect, can you upload the MRI's (deidentified of course)? Or perhaps strongly downsampled (using ft_volumedownsample; also less identifiable), whatever problem exist should remain. \n\nWhat is your Matlab version? \n\nApart from that, the realignment looks reasonable, although it's difficult to judge without going back and forth along the brain/csf/skull boundaries. If its a grid patient, there could be tremendous swelling causing part of the brain to shift inward (easily a cm or more). My hope would be that the skull is at least aligned well."
