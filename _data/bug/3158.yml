          This causes problems in ft_sourceinterpolate, and possibly elsewhere as well.

          a call to ft_datatype() with a formerly known as 'source' datatype structure now returns a 'pointcloud'.

        thetext: Thus far point clouds were only used in ft_defacevolume. For know we could change it that it asks for the datatype source. So I could erase  datatype point cloud, because as JM already mentioned pointclouds and sources are not distinguishable.

          Can you specify which version of fieldtrip you used? Recently a lot of changes were made with this function so a version not later than today would be best. Can you also post the structure of the data you used?
          'That is detected as 'source' and then it uses inside rather than to remove positions.'
          I think with this you refer to ft_defacevolume?

          Hi, I am using the 0711 version. Robert suggest there maybe a bug here. Yes, I am referring to ft_defacevolume. The data structure is the MEG head points.
