          I am getting these error messages:

               Reference to non-existent field 'datafile'.

               Error in ft_artifact_zvalue>redraw_cb (line 906)
                 data = ft_read_data(cfg.datafile,   'header', hdr, 'begsample', trl(trlop,1),
                 'endsample', trl(trlop,2), 'chanindx', sgnind, 'checkboundary',
                 strcmp(cfg.continuous,'no'));

               Error in ft_artifact_zvalue (line 498)
                 redraw_cb(h);

               Error in FT_preprocFear_chunks_TEM (line 401)
                             [~, artifact.thetafreq{t}] = ft_artifact_zvalue(cfg,data);

          The line where the error is thrown is under "else" for "if ~isempty(opt.data)" -- meaning it's trying to reload the data from the file when it can't find it in opt.  Since I am including the data as an input to ft_artifact_zvalue, I'm not sure why it's not showing up in opt.data in this subfunction.  Tracking it back into the main ft_artifact_zvalue function, I think this bit at line 478 could be the problem:

          if hasdata
            opt.data = {};
          else
            opt.data = data;
          end

          Isn't that backwards?  Adding a tilde to hasdata seems to fix it.  Was this changed recently?  I've only had this problem after downloading the latest version to troubleshoot another bug yesterday.

It has to do with https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/ce2c0806 related to http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3077\nwhere I made a change to deal better with cfg.inputfile input. \n\nSo actually there are three options to consider, where 3 was not working correctly on all MATLAB versions:\n\n1) cfg.dataset\n2) data provided as input arg\n3) data read from cfg.inputfile\n\nI agree to your proposed solution. This should fix it:\n\n130-229-40-210> git commit ft_artifact_zvalue.m\n[master 609bad9] FIX - hasdata should be ~hasdata, see http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3093 and thanks to Theresa\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\n130-229-40-210> git push upstream master\nX11 forwarding request failed on channel 0\nYou're about to push master, is that what you intended?
