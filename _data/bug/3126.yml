          See http://www.megaemg.com/products/neurone-eeg-system. This is the system that is used in Jyvaskyla for the ChildBrain project.

          Apparently there exists already matlab code (hinted at by the EEGLAB route taken so far).

          this might be an easy one, since on
          http://www.megaemg.com/support/unrestricted-downloads/
          there is code available.

          Could someone from Jyvaskyla send me a (preferably not too large) example file? The recording should also have some events/triggers.

          Please see http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/how_should_i_send_example_data_to_the_developers

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #1)

          Unfortunately, our data is not less than 1000KB.  Therefore, we uploaded our pilot dataset with trigger codes in the dropbox.

          Please find the data in the below link.
          https://www.dropbox.com/s/ver0txk917x36sx/Example%20neuro%20data_%20Jyvaskyla.zip?dl=0

          Thank you.

          mac011> git commit -a
          [bug3126-neurone 53f44af] ENH - added initial support for mega_neurone EEG format, see http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3126. The actual reading of header, data and events still needs to be added, but it contains the placeholders.

          it will now appear in the release version. The only thing I am not 100% sure about is whether the sample offset of triggers on line 1268 in ft_read_event

          event(i).sample   = round(NEURONE.event(i).latency * 0.001 * NEURONE.srate + 1);

          is computed correctly. In worst case I think it would only be a single sample (i.e. 1 ms) off.
