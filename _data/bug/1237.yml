          It turns out that the file permissions were not OK. Apparently (which sort of makes sense, but not at first glance) MATLAB needs execute permissions for its MEX-files *on Windows only*. After I execute:

          1011 $ chmod ag+rx ft_getopt.*

          on a Linux terminal, everything works fine. This is actually quite strange, since the Linux versions of the MEX-files work perfectly well without execute permissions. So it seems like the Samba server is understanding that Windows MATLAB wants to execute the MEX-file, then checks for the appropriate Linux permission, and then refuses access in case it is not present. The weird thing is of course that Windows does not even have an "execute" permission, but anyway.

          I will now check whether changing permissions and committing also results in the permissions being updated in the repository.

          SVN does not keep track of file permissions. However, I have found the special svn:executable property, which tells SVN that the file needs to have its executable flag set. I set this property on all MEX-files, and committed (rev 5096) the change. This should cause the executable flag to be set whenever a working copy (including the /home/common/fieldtrip/ one) is updated.

          For the future: anyone committing a new MEX-file needs to make sure the svn:executable property is set (to '*', it's the only valid value). Also, make sure any autosync-ed versions of the file also have this property set.

          I encountered the problem again in an external folder:
          ??? Invalid MEX-file 'M:\FieldTrip\trunk\external\spm8\spm_bwlabel.mexw64': Access is denied.

          Although we are not supposed to keep track of of external toolboxes, I guess it's a wise idea to change their file permissions as well? (I did it now locally on my machine)

          I tried setting the svn:executable flag on the externals/ mex-files as well, but that gave a permission denied error when I committed those changes. I'm adding Robert as CC, he could probably fix this :)

          The problem is with fieldtrip/external/; I don't think we can set the svn:executable flag on files in that directory. I was able to set the flag on all mex-files, in all folders, *except* for /external/

          Desired is that all mex-files, for all platforms, in all subfolders, have the svn:executable property set to '*' (the only allowed value). This will solve the 'Access is denied' issue with the mex-files on Windows, when accessing them through a Samba server.

          For .m files setting the property either way does not matter (but it might indeed be tidy to have it not be present, as per the wiki page).
