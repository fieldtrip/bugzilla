          the pnt-matrix returned contains duplicate positions for channel 1 and 257

          check what's wrong and fix it.

          made a temporary fix by changing the value of 0.5 in line 63 in channelposition into 0.4
          This is very nasty one, and we should discuss in the fieldtrip meeting how to make the detection more robust.

          I created a tentative fix in channelposition

          @ stephen & diego: can you guys check whether ft_megplanar still gives nans in some channels?

          Cheers,

          It's done. you'll find 4 files in the common temporary folder. For example data_good_after_IC_before_planar.mat is the data with no problems in ploting ('good_') after IC rejection ('after_IC') and before planar calculation ('before_planar'). I did that because I'm suspecting that IC rejection step is doing something rare with the channel configuration => see this bug

          I cannot reproduce the problem.

          I work with the 4 grad structures in the attachment #72. These are obtained from the 4 data structures posted by Diego.

          I do the following:


          cfg = [];
          cfg.neighbourdist = 4;

          cd ~/matlab/fieldtrip/private
          grad1p = megplanar(cfg, grad1); % etc for the other 3

          any(isnan(grad1p.tra(:)))  %returns 0 in all 4 cases.

          My diagnosis is that the problem is not caused by the issue in channelposition.
