          Something changed within the past week that breaks channel selection for Elekta data, so that basic calls like the following yield no channels at all:
          cfg.dataset = 'meg.fif'
          cfg.channel = {'MEG'};
          data = ft_preprocessing(cfg);

          If no cfg.channel is specified, all channels load as expected. However ft_chantype reports 'unknown' for all channels (with the exception that 'eog' is correctly recognized), so I suppose this is why channel selection fails.

          Maybe this was introduced by recent changes in ft_datatype_sens?

          is this for native elekta data, or after ICA cleaning and backprojecting?

          This is for native/continuous data (no max filter etc). I don't have a small dataset on hand since I'm at HBM, and the data I see on your FTP is already imported into mat files.

          But I believe the code I wrote above would fail with any elekta data imported from the raw FIF file.

          However with the data called 'subjectK.mat':
          load subjectK
          ft_chantype(data_left)

          Returns mostly channel type 'unknown'

          Even after this fix, cfg.channel input like 'MEG', 'MEGMAG', or 'MEGGRAD' into ft_sourceanalysis fails because no channels are found. (Again with Elekta, perhaps other systems are affected as well?)

          I traced this down to line 657 in ft_selectdata.m:
          selchannel = ft_channelselection(cfg.channel, varargin{k}.label);

          This will output an empty matrix for Elekta channel labels. Providing the senstype could fix this:
          selchannel = ft_channelselection(cfg.channel,varargin{k}.label,varargin{k}.grad.type);

          However, I don't know of a general solution that does not break other datatypes; e.g., EEG data would not have a grad substructure. Any suggestions?

          Okay - so here is the problem for real:

          Line 356, etc., in ft_senstype reads:

           % there are two possibilities for the neuromag channel labels: with and without a space, hence the 0.4
              elseif all(mean(ismember(ft_senslabel('neuromag306_combined'), sens.label)) > 0.4)
                type = 'neuromag306_combined';
              elseif all(mean(ismember(ft_senslabel('neuromag306'),          sens.label)) > 0.4)
                type = 'neuromag306';

          Now, for Neuromag data ft_senslabel gives 2 (combined) or 3 (original) columns of labels for each channel, e.g. MEG0112, MEG0113, MEG0111 for the original, and MEG0111, MEG0112+MEG0113 for the combined. Now, by using "any" in the above code, it will fail to recognize it as neuromag when you input either only combined, or only gradiometers, which is often the case.

          I suggest the following solution:

          1) make the case neuromagXXX_combined depend only on the combined labels from ft_senslabel, i.e. the second column. Only these are unique.
          2*) use ANY instead of ALL, and keep this order of cases (both the original and the combined condition will be a hit).

          Actually 2 is the only feasible one, since this would also allow one to input only magnetometers.

          Cheers,
          Stephen
