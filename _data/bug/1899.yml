          around line 201 in ft_read_mri there is a matlab shift introduced to correct different indexing schemes between matlab and C.

          matlab_shift = [ 0 0 0 0.001; 0 0 0 -0.001; 0 0 0 0.001; 0 0 0 0];
          % transform transforms from 2001 to 5 and further to 4
          transform = transform\(hdr.voxel_trans.trans+matlab_shift);
          %end code

          this inputs a physical shift of 1 mm in the origin of each dimension. this only works with 1mm resolution mris and would have problems with oblique mris as well.

          I better approach would be to introduce the shift in voxel coordinates ie to map voxel (1,1,1) to voxel (0,0,0)

          this could be accomplished like this:

          matlab_shift = eye(4);
          matlab_shift(1:3,4) = [-1,-1,-1];
          transform = transform\(hdr.voxel_trans.trans * matlab_shift);

          Best regards,
          Luke

          Hi Luke,

          Thanks for finding this out. I CC this bug to Burkhard Maess, who contributed the original patch to deal with transformation matrices in fif-mris.
          I'd be happy to incorporate your suggested change, but I suggest to involve Burkhard in this. If Burkhard agrees too, I'll do it. I don't have fif-mris available myself, so I have to rely on you guys in this.

          Cheers,

          JM

          Hi Luke and  Jan-Mathijs ,

          I also like to thank Luke for this correction. I will be happy to find it in the new version.

          all the best and a Happy New Year,
          Burkhard

          Patch as suggested included in revision 7274.

          @ Luke: could you test and report back whether it works as intended, so I can close the bug?

          @ both: happy new year to you too!
