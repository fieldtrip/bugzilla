          We recorded material with the Epiphan and with a Zoom H2n digital microphone.

          The audio in the Epiphan recordings on the first few days was poor (to soft), hence the audio from the Zoom has to be mixed into the video.

          Hmm, there are two copies now. I'll consolidate to the first copy, i.e. documented on 3422.
