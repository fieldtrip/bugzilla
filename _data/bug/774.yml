        thetext: "This error pops up recently whereas the functionality was fine before.\n\nPaul suggests it may be related to a recent change in fMRI sequencing, see message below. \n\nPaul will first try to use the old sequence and check whether the motion monitoring still works fine. If so, it is related to the new sequence protocol and adapatations to this sequence need to be made in FT.\n\n\nDear all (scanning on the Trio),\n\nsome time ago we informed you about instabilities in single slices on \nthe Trio which occured regularly when using the 32 channel coil. After a \nlengthy process and discussion with Siemens, it became clear that this \nis not a site specific problem. Siemens proposes to use a more stable \nphase correction scheme. We have implemented this in the home made \n(ME)EPI sequence(BP_ep2d_multipurpose) on the Trio, which should now \nreduce this fluctuating ghosts. You don't have to do anything, all your \nprotocols still work as before.\n\nIf you have very long scans, you might still experience slowly \nincreasing ghosts, there is currently no solution on the sequence side \nfor this (except to keep your run length reasonably short). However, the \ninfluence of these will be reduced by the (standard) high-pass temporal \nfiltering in the pre-processing steps.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please contact Paul or me.\n\nSuccess with the scanning,\n\nMarkus & Paul"

          Paul tested with the old sequence and the function worked again.

          Intriguingly, when using the new sequence again, the realtime monitoring also still works fine..
