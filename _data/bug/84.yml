          ??? At compilation, "keep" was determined to be a variable and this
           variable is uninitialized.  "keep" is also a function name and previous versions of MATLAB would have called the function.
           However, MATLAB 7 forbids the use of the same name in the same
           context as both a function and a variable.

          Error in ==> ft_freqanalysis_mtmconvol at 288
          if keep == 1

          Error in ==> ft_freqanalysis at 98
            [freq] = feval(sprintf('ft_freqanalysis_%s',lower(cfg.method)), cfg, data);


          -----------------

          this var name is used in several freqanalysis and connectivityanalysis functions, but its also a function name in /public

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
