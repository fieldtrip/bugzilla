          Created attachment 325
          Test script/function spikefield tutorial - Neurosim data

          As it stands now, I interpret the extracellular potential found in 'signals' as an LFP. This signal seems to be some sort of superposition of extracellular potentials in the different subnetworks (in this case, 2 exist).
          The simulating of LFP signals on Neurosim's side might still need some work, however the implementation in FieldTrip works. (using the patch for ft_channelselection.m mentioned above is used).
          The simulated data is the same as in the other tutorial ('spikes' and 'signals'), I shall add them again for completeness.

          They should not go in data/ftp, but in data/test in a subdir.

          you should have the permissions to do

          cd /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test
          mkdir bug1720

          and then copy the files in the subdir.

          But shouldn't the test_tutorial functions go to fieldtrip/test?
