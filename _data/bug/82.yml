        thetext: volumewrite_spm is in fieldtrip/private and may be only called from m-files in the main fieldtrip directory. This should be checked by the way. Anyway, it may be more natural to move volumewrite_spm to fileio/private and create a file-external in fieldtrip/private for this purpose. Consider also renaming the function into write_spm_volume or so.

          I created a function in fileio: ft_write_volume. It has the same api as the other ft_write_XXX functions and so far can write analyze, using spm (based on fileio/private/volumewrite_spm), and .mgz using freesurfer.

          In fieldtrip-main, I changed calls to volumewrite_spm into ft_write_volume

          To do:

          -build in support of nifti
          -move functionality of ft_volumewrite into ft_write_volume (e.g. writing of brainvoyager files)
