        thetext: On http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development there is a link to http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/problems, which lists "FIXME" and "TODO" instances in the code, and which lists (automatically) potential documentation problems. That page has not been revisited for a long time. Please check whether it contains anything useful and if so, it should be dealt with.

        thetext: I think we should go over this once, at least checking the empty links and the pages that are not pointed from any other page. Sounds relatively straightforward. Assigning to a named person to revive this one. I suggest to discuss at next FT-meeting.

        thetext: It seems that with the new website this page has vanished. Or at least it is not linked anymore. I suggest to close this.
