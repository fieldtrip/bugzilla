          Created attachment 295
          data example

          Hi,

          I got the attached dataset from a user. When trying to convert it I get NaNs as the data. It comes down to line 50 in read_brainvision_vhdr which sets the resolution to NaN and then these NaNs are multiplied with the data. I could fix it to some extent by changing this line to:

          hdr.resolution(i) = 1;

          But why should it be NaN in the first place?

          Vladimir

          I think a principled fix would involve the 'units' field. If there is a resolution field it should be set if not then it should be 'unknown'. But I'd make sure why Robert put that NaN there. Maybe there is some other reason.

          (In reply to comment #4)

          I think I implemented it with nan to ensure that it would get detected in case the resolution was not specified in the vhdr file, and because I would not know when that specific case might happen. So catching the special case worked out ;-)

          You guys have now though of it and considered the actual case where the resolution is not known. Hence I think that your solution will be fine in general.
