The 1st is a modified version of it, processed by Rembrandt Bakker (a colleague of mine at the Donders in Nijmegen).\n\nAllen Inst. seems again a bit ambiguous w.r.t. positive and negative directions, whereas Rembrandt made the directions explicit.\n\nSo my feeling is that the possible ambiguous situation regarding the two should be documented as well."

          On http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/siv/?imageId=102162303 it is visible how positive and negative relate to bregma. Positive is anterior of bregma, negative is posterior. This is consistent with the definition of the Y axis in http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_are_the_different_head_and_mri_coordinate_systems_defined?&#details_on_the_allen_institute_mouse_coordinate_system, which is:

          The origin of the coordinate system is at the Bregma point.
          The Y-axis points from posterior (-) to anterior (+).

          It also means that within slice the X and Z axis are visible. The interpretation used by scalablebrainatlas is that:

          The X-axis points from left (-) to right (+).
          The Z-axis points from inferior (-) to superior (+).

          This means that the scalablebrainatlas coordinate system is consistent with that of the allen institute.

          It defines

          but does not specify X and Y directions.

          Regarding the Allen inst. coordinate system:

          bregma is along the y-axis, is lambda also along the y-axis? To be checked.
