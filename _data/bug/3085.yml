          the way the plot currently looks

          See attachment for how the plot (TFR tutorial) looks now (Matlab 2015a, Ubuntu 14.04 for me; also confirmed on 2014a, Windows 7 by Johanna). This is different from the wiki: http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/_media/tutorial/timefrequencyanalysis/tfrhannmult.png

          We would say the old version is better. Perhaps this change was introduced when Matlab switched to Handle Graphics 2?

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
