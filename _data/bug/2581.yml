          I tried to connect to the neurosky mindwave device alone and with neurosky thinkgear running. There was no success, even though COM11 serial port was used and registered in neurosky thinkgear application.

          The error was "Unable to connect to the COM11 serial port", I tried other ports as well, but with no success. I also tested connection through port COM11 with BCI2000 and it works perfectly, so the connection itself is not a problem.

          I have to state that COM9 serial port manages to go through and connect (regardless of the device connectivity status), but there is no data sent to the buffer, only the header, with no subsequent data sent, probably because the device is on COM11.

          I am using a simple configuration file
          [select]
          1=Ns1
          2=Ns2
          3=Ns3
          4=Ns4
          5=Ns5
          6=Ns6
          7=Ns7

Also, the person who wrote the code has left since.\n\nThe error that you give is one that I cannot find in the source code files in fieldtrip/realtime/src/acquisition/neurosky, which suggests that it is a system error rather than an error in the code. \n\nMight it be that some other piece of software is blocking the thinkgear2ft.exe to access the port?\n\nI'll include a colleague at another centre here on the discussion: @Jason, do you happen to have a neurosky headset?"

          why don't you use com11 for thinkgear2ft.exe?

          No I haven't, so I am not sure of what is going on between the two.

          I just reported the problem, hopefully you can recreate it ad fix it (providing the is a problem and not just my clumsiness)

          Dear Petar, Robert,

          I've just tried the thinkgear2ft on a windows 7 machine we have here.  Connecting to the device was fine (once I had installed the mindwave tools).  I couldn't actually get any data out of it (due to lots of invalid-packet errors), however Petar's reported problem of not being able to access the device was not a problem.  Note however, I was running as administrator...

          Jason
