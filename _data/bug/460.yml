        thetext: When running ft_preprocessing, Matlab has to open my TRC file many times, but as there isn't fclose(fid) at the end of the read_micromed_trc.m file, it stops at some point (??? Error using ==> read_micromed_trc at 12 Can't open *.trc file) and cannot open my file anymore. Adding fclose(fid) at the end of the file fixes the bug.
