          When preprocessing my CTF data i get the following 'warning':

          getCTFdata: dataList error: points=2389:2388   trial=89   points/trial=12000  No. of trials=170

          subsequenty I end up with one broken trial. No disaster, just want to document in case of future system issues or whatever

        thetext: CTF writes data in segments, which (in case of continuous recordings) are usually 10 seconds long. Apparently your last segment of the file was not completely written. My conclusion is that your dataset is (mildly) broken, and that is something that FT is not able to fix.

          Just to be clear, its not the last part of the file since the broken trial was somewhere in the middle (trial 89 of 170).

          This bug was filed more as a technical note, to make sure it is reported someplace, perhaps for inhouse awareness, in case it repeats itself. (I would not expect FT to be able to fix it).

          (In reply to comment #4)

          it could still be at the end of a file. New files are created for every 2GB chunk of data. So it might be the meg_1 file, whereas the meg_2 file is again ok.

          And end-of file problem could also have been introduced when copying the data.

          I cleaned up my bugzilla list by changing the status from resolved (either fixed or wontfix) into closed. If you don't agree, please reopen the bug.
