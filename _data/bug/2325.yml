          my data that works for me :)

          Hi Nietzsche,

          try to work your way updwards - put a breakpoint to the line of the warning and use the commands dbup and dbdown to go through your stack (use dbstack to check the current stack). Try to identify why the warning occurs (what if-statement is true for the warning to be thrown, does that make sense?), then put another breakpoint to some line where the variables checked in the if-statement are assigned and check why they get the value they get. This is a recursive procedure, so you put breakpoints at lines where something crucial happens, check variables and try to identify earlier lines where something might have gone wrong, set another breakpoint, etc.
          success eermee ;)

          btw, the function works fine for me with my data. I attached my data so that you can compare what goes wrong with the tutorial data and works with my data. I use:

          cfg  = [];
          cfg.layout = 'easycapM15';
          cfg.preproc.detrend = 'yes';
          figure;
          ft_multiplotER(cfg, gatimelock);

          Oh, oh! So it seems that the problem was setting the axes too tightly.
          When I specified cfg.ylim = ''; then the data plotted just fine.  So I should probably change something about the axis limits, weird how this didn't happen before.. I'll keep digging!

          As extra tip, commands that I find very useful when debugging (which for some reason I only learned of after 4 years):
          dbup   - when in debugmode, move your workspace up one function call
          dbdown - when in debugmode, move your workspace down one function call
          dbstop if error - enter debugmode when an error occurs
          dbclear if error - clear the above
          dbstop if warning - enter debugmode when a warning occurs
          dbclear if warning - clear the above


          A warning like Robert's sounds like a good idea

          Thanks guys!
          I actually looked into this again, and there was just no problem...
          I got the user's data, called ft_timelockanalysis and then ft_multiplotER and all the waveforms were there.  I'm just waiting to see if the user will get back to me to say if it worked for her or not.

          I looked at the previous comments again, went through the code with debug mode to check my suspicion.  My suspicion is correct: younger me had issues with magnitude and scales.

          [-3e13 3e13]  should have been  [-3e-13 3e-13]

          closing bug.
