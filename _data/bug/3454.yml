          Are you referring to the single channel or to the multi channel tutorial?

          Please feel free to add a small section to the tutorial which specifies how to add the required toolbox to the path.

          How do you suggest to fix this (both in terms of what should be done, and who is going to do this)?

          I think that from a didactical point of view, the setting of the paths should be explained in the tutorial(s).

          And from a didactical point of view, it would be good if you did this. That is, if you have editing permissions for the tutorial, but that is the idea of a wiki, isn't it?

        thetext: "What has to be done is that the function either needs to be moved in the folder, or the correct folder has to be added to the path. As for who should do it, I don't know. \nI do not work with the fieldtrip toolbox, I  was just exploring its functions out of curiosity. This is why I didn't want to edit it, as I'm not familiar with its customs. Unfortunately I do not have the time to delve into the fieldtrip tutorials and code, but didn't want to ignore a mistake in the tutorial. I hope you can find someone who can edit it so others won't get stuck as wel. Sorry for not being able to help."
