          Please note that if one runs for instance ft_singleplotTFR(cfg,x), and in the 'x' inserts x.dimord=freq_time, as done before -- there is an error message returning "index exceeds matrix dimensions".

          I think it should be noted to the users that a change to the code has been made regarding the field "dimord".

          Hi Yoni,

          Could you be a bit more specific, and upload some data that reproduces the problem?

        thetext: "Hi Jan-Mathijs,\n\nI just noticed that my previous script, which ran:\n\n\"\n.\n.\n.\nstat=ft_freqstatistics(cfg,freq)\nstat.dimord='freq_time'; \n.\n.\n.\nft_singleplotTFR(cfg,stat)\n\"\n\n- is returning an error message: \"index exceeds matrix dimensions\".\n\nThis error message is not returned if I omit \nstat.dimord='freq_time'; \n\nSo I think that somewhere the code for one of the two functions was changed? but that it is not clear to the user what to do with the dimord field\n\nI attached the \"stat\" file in the previous comment.\n\n(In reply to comment #1)"

          I don't know about the old behavior, but indeed the dimord should be 'chan_freq_time',  because the dimensionality of the numeric data in this case is: 1xNfreqxNtime.

          Had the dimensionality been NfreqxNtime, the dimord should have been 'freq_time'.

          I don't know what was going on with your data, but to me this just seems to work fine.

          Agreed?
