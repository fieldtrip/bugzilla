          Hi there,

          I don't know why this error only occurs now, as it seems logically broken:

          On line 971 ft_selectdata checks whether the selected time period fall within the range of the time-axis:

          elseif numel(cfg.latency)==2
            % the [min max] range can be specifed with +inf or -inf, but should
            % at least partially overlap with the time axis of the input data
            mintime = min(alltimevec);
            maxtime = max(alltimevec);
            if all(cfg.latency<mintime) || all(cfg.latency>maxtime)
              ft_error('the selected time range falls outside the time axis in the data');
            end

          However, if indeed latency is selected as e.g.: cfg.latency = [-1 2], then wouldn't the comparison of cfg.latency < mintime, not specify the first input of cfg.latency, and the second in the second part of the evaluation? I.e.:

            if all(cfg.latency(1)<mintime) || all(cfg.latency(2)>maxtime)
              ft_error('the selected time range falls outside the time axis in the data');
            end

          Again, this is old code, right? So don't understand why only now I get an error. But it does now.

          Best,
          Stephen

          if the whole time specification is to the left of the time-axis, or the whole time-specification is to the right, there is no overlap.

          Please specify an example that demonstrates the error you think exists.
