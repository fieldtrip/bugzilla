          this was a problem encountered at the workshop in Krakow.

          Some people have *.vhdr, *.vmrk and *.dat, and specify the dat file as cfg.dataset. FieldTrip then cannot autodetect the format. If they specify the vhdr the detection is fine.

          Usually at the DCCN the *.vhdr and *.vmrk files are complemented with a *.eeg file or with a *.seg file. Either one of the three should work -> just check for the presence of the triplet.

          TODO make test case with three examples

          test01.vhdr
          test01.vmrk
          test01.dat

          test01.vhdr
          test01.vmrk
          test01.seg

          test01.vhdr
          test01.vmrk
          test01.eeg

          and ensure that either one of these files is autodetected properly. Also see the dataset2files function (which is a.o. used in ft_checkconfig to assign the datafile and headerfile given the dataset).

        thetext: "I've added a test-script for this bug that attempts to load data from all the test cases mentioned above. \n\nIt currently fails on two accounts:\n\n1. if cfg.dataset is set with a marker-file (*.vmrk).\nThis appears to fail becuase dataset2files does not have a case to handle 'brainvision-vmrk' file formats. However, do we intend to allow users to specify a marker file as a dataset? We currently allow and support to specify the data itself and the headerfile.\n\n2. if cfg.dataset is set with a .dat file that has an ascii data format and is vectorized.\nThis appears to fail in read_brainvision_vhdr.m at line 88: fid = fopen(hdr.DataFile, 'rt');\n\nfopen cannot open the file because hdr.DataFile only contains the filename, not the full location. fopen therefore cannot find the file."

          I would not worry about case "1". It has never been an issue, people seem to be happy specifying the vhdr or eeg/dat file as dataset name.

          I consider your item "2" is a user error. If you specify the name of a file without path, and that file is not in the pwd, reading fails for all file formats (not only brainvision).

        thetext: Sorry, I just realised I was not clear enough about problem 2. Problem 2 also occurs if you specify a full path in cfg.dataset because fopen in read_brainvision_vhdr uses hdr.DataFile, which appears to only contain the filename (not full file path).

          ah, that makes more sense. Yes, that can be considered as a bug.

          One of the two cases within the same if-statement was already adding the full path to the filename so I moved that line of code outside of the if-statement so it can by used by both cases. The bug is thereby fixed.
