Here I should note that datasource is not a clear name. (it was copied from BCI2000).\n\nPerhaps \nfieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/*.m\nfieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/ctf/..\nfieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/neuralynx/..\nfieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/brainamp/rda2ft.exe\n\nor \nfieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/matlab/ft_realtime_xxxproxy*.m\nfieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/ctf/..\nfieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/neuralynx/..\nfieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/brainamp/rda2ft.exe\n\nAutomatic managing of the path settings/directories (through fieldtripdefs) should be kept in mind with all changes."

          Ok.

          And what do you think about removing the "proxy" part of the Matlab function name?

          What do you think is more attractive to the end users:

          ft_realtime_asaproxy.m
          ft_realtime_brainampproxy.m
          ft_realtime_ctfproxy.m
          ft_realtime_fileproxy.m
          ft_realtime_fmriproxy.m
          ft_realtime_micromedproxy.p
          ft_realtime_neuralynxproxy.m
          ft_realtime_pooraudioproxy.m
          ft_realtime_signalproxy.m

          or

          ft_realtime_asa.m
          ft_realtime_brainamp.m
          ft_realtime_ctf.m
          ft_realtime_file.m
          ft_realtime_fmri.m
          ft_realtime_micromed.p
          ft_realtime_neuralynx.m
          ft_realtime_pooraudio.m
          ft_realtime_signal.m

        thetext: I would just stick to the ***proxy names, even if they don't look too sexy. The "___2ft" scheme looks a bit redundant because the functions already have a "ft_" prefix, and just ft_realtime_ctf might be confusing, because that could also refer to some realtime process function based on CTF data. Sure, it's in the "datasource" directory, but if it's on the path that extra distinction isn't so obvious anymore.

        thetext: I moved the relevant C-based tools into datasource.
