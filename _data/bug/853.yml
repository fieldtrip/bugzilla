        thetext: np, just wondered, is the error maybe that the timewindow that is getting marked does not overlap with the selected one? If it's that, then I fixed it for the vertical viewmode, but apparently not for butterfly viewmode

          Instead of distinguishing between the viewmodes, marking of artifacts is the same for both viewmodes now (which is possible due to restructuring the code)
