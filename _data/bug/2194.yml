        thetext: "I've noticed that browsing through my own data for visual artifact rejection I spend the most time selecting a time range and clicking it to mark it for rejection (since I have about 1800 trials per subject to go through, it adds up). \n\nAs I wish to completely reject the marked trial, having a single keyboard button to select the entire trial would greatly speed-up this process.\n\nFor my local copy of FieldTrip I've modified ft_databrowser to mark the entire trial when the 'a'-key is pressed (a for artifact ;) ). I've added the following lines (copied,pasted and slightly modified from the segment that handles selecting and marking time-ranges with the mouse):\n\ncase 'a'\n    % select complete trial\n    begsample = opt.trlvis(opt.trlop,1);\n    endsample = opt.trlvis(opt.trlop,2);\n    \n    artval = opt.artdata.trial{1}(opt.ftsel, begsample:endsample);\n    artval = any(artval,1);\n    if any(artval)\n      fprintf('there is overlap with the active artifact (%s), disabling this artifact\\n',opt.artdata.label{opt.ftsel});\n      opt.artdata.trial{1}(opt.ftsel, begsample:endsample) = 0;\n    else\n      fprintf('there is no overlap with the active artifact (%s), marking this as a new artifact\\n',opt.artdata.label{opt.ftsel});\n      opt.artdata.trial{1}(opt.ftsel, begsample:endsample) = 1;\n    end\n    \n    % redraw only when marking (so the focus doesn't go back to the databrowser   after calling selfuns\n    setappdata(h, 'opt', opt);\n    setappdata(h, 'cfg', cfg);\n    redraw_cb(h);"

          a bit offtopic:
          for that purpose, ft_rejectvisual in channel viewmode might be better suited (if you click on a trial, it gets marked as bad)

        thetext: wontfix, given Jorn's comment, and given that there was no incentive to revisit this for the last 8 years or so.
