I used it in the past as follows. \n\nI made two *.bib files, one from our wiki and one (using a text editor using the \"import into bibtex\" option \non http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2013&hl=en&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&cites=3328911510682538425&scipsc=\n\nread them in BibDesk and merge them. Within BibDesk it is doable to deal with conflicting versions of the same paper by sorting them on title.\n\nPS I suspect that the 2nd half of 2012 also still needs to be included."

          The merged file did not display correctly. After replacing @phdthesis and @inproceedings with @article, it displays and sorts correctly. This is apparently a limitation of the inlinebib plugin.

          I also used VIM to fix some uppercase problems.

          It would still be possible to improve on the references, but that requires a lot of manual labor.
