          on line 1249 it fails, because fn{ii} = 'chancmb', so it tries to convert chancmb as if it were data.

          I have stored the data and will upload it later to reproduce and fix.

          PS did you know that storing the data+cfg that causes an error is as easy as specifying cfg.debug='saveonerror'?

          This seems to fix the bug of ft_checkdata seeing labelcmb as a data field but now another bug pops up for this test script. For some reason if there is only one frequency, data.freq = NaN. This also seems to be an issue with ft_checkdata

        thetext: "I found the culprit: \n\nft_selectdata uses nans to indicate no sub-selection needs to be made (i.e. output=input). However, one line of code which is intended to update the freq field after a selection replaces data.freq with the selected frequency (nan in case of no sub-selection). This happens when you specify the exact frequencies you wish to select, which automatically happens when you only have one frequency:\n\nlines 1048-1053:\nfor k = 1:ndata\n  if isequal(freqindx{k}, 1:length(varargin{k}.freq))\n    % the cfg was updated, but no selection is needed for the data\n    freqindx{k} = nan;\n  end\nend\n\nI changed the following line to check for nans.

          Disregard the last comment. I added the buggy lines causing the last problem as an ad-hoc fix to the first problem (in my personal copy). I then forgot I added those lines.

          I've removed them and ft_selectdata works fine after only solving the first issue ;)
