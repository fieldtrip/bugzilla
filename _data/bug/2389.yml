          Created attachment 564
          changed version of ft_chantype.m see lines 345 and 346

          We have a 4D-BTi 248-MEG/32-EEG-channel system.

          In our case EEG channel labels end with '-1' rather than begin with 'E' (as expected in ft_chantype.m).

          See lines 345 and 346 in the attached file, line 345 is the commented original code, and 346 is a proposed solution.

          Maybe there are other 4D-BTi machines (or the labels can be customized in the machine settings), hence I think that the best solution is to recognize both the labels starting with 'E' and those ending with '-1' as EEG channels.

          Hi Pawel,

          Thanks for reporting. Where's the machine located that you are talking about?

          The 4D systems are notorious for being inconsistent with channel names etc
          across sites. For this reason it is hard to provide foolproof and robust
          solutions in the reading routines. Therefore, we are trying to compile a set of
          test datafiles that we can use to optimize the code (see bug 2027 for more
          info). Could you provide us with such a small dataset. What I would need is
          just a small binary file (can be c,rfDC or e,rfhp...) + the corresponding
          config file.
          Your request is reasonable, but I would like to have some testdata to try it
          out myself. Also, we should probably consider not relying on the channel names,
          but use the information that is in the binary to classify the channels, i.e. if
          I recall correctly, each channel also has a number attached that designates its
          class.

          (In reply to comment #2)
          Thanks a lot,

          we are already on the map, greetings from Magdeburg - Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology :)

          The smallest dataset we currently have is about 70MB, is it ok?

          How can I send such a big file to you? (I need to ask the head of my lab if I can; we can prepare smaller file but in about 2 weeks because now MEG is under being maintained)
