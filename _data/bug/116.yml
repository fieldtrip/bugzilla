          I have the following code in my function in MEEGTools toolbox in SPM:

          data.cfg.trl(:, 4) = 1:length(trlind);

          data = ft_rejectvisual(cfg, data);

          % Figure out based on the output of FT function what trials and channels to
          % reject
          trlsel = ones(1, length(trlind));
          trlsel(data.cfg.trl(:, 4)) = 0;

          This was once suggested by Robert. The idea is that rejectvisual should update the trl and I use it to figure out which trials were rejected. This used to work but doesn't any more as data.cfg.trl is empty in the output.

          This probably is related to the stuff documented here:

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/ensure_consistend_trial_definition

          and

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/is_it_possible_to_keep_track_of_trial-specific_information_in_my_fieldtrip_analysis_pipeline

          If understood correctly, you rely on ft_rejectvisual to prune the trl-matrix which is hidden in the data.cfg.
          Trial-specific information (coded by column # >3) has moved to data.trialinfo.
          Probably, changing data.cfg.trl(:,4) = 1:length(trlind) into data.trialinfo = [1:numel(trlind)]'; and according changes later on will fix the problem.
