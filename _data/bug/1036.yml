          Todos:

           - check whether the use of panels and ft_uilayout are compatible. if so, do this
           - merge parameter and control panels
           - implement view modes in view panel for 3D data. Hide for 2D data and adjust window size accordingly
           - fix size of control elements s.t. maximizing the window on a 200" screen does not result in 100" buttons but in a 190" movie
           - make panels hide-able (like tabs). if a panel should popup, decrease size of movie-axis, if a panel hides, increase size again (see also the point above)
           - add manual time selection, similar to colorbar, e.g. "play movie only from -0.2s to 0.4s, although -1s to 2s would be possible"
           - maybe make playback speed selection as an inputbox
           - adjust slider stepsize (i.e. one slider step == one step in freq/time)
           - can playback be made faster so that faster speed results in more images, not skipping certain periods of time?
           - make mask adjusting opacity instead of replacing the color
           - add a browse_fun, just for JM ;)
           - implement recording function (i.e. store images in a matrix and return it) - any need for compression? look up matlab functions and at the code I got from the DCC
           - implement non-interactive mode (just play the movie, then close the window, return a image-matrix if desired/cfg.recording='yes')
           - split moviefunction into separate topo and source functions. divide the load s.t. moviefunction takes over GUI-handling, the separate functions updating of the image (work with handles here)

          aight, still a lot to do :)

I could go on and further develop my private version of ft_sourcemovie, but it would make more sense to further develop the ft_movieplot. Any chance that I can get a sneak preview?\n\nMy old ft_sourcemovie allowed for the storage of the image-frames into a matlab-movie, which can then be saved as an .avi file. No compression possible in linux unfortunately. We should ask Arjen how he creates his movies."

          worked on it again, fixed the following:

           x implement recording function (i.e. store images in a matrix and return it) -
          any need for compression? look up matlab functions and at the code I got from
          the DCC

          In newer Matlab version, there is the VideoWriter command, which creates a VideoObject - fancy fancy, but it's just like avifile. The only difference is that it can write Motion JPEG compressed videos. However, this does not work for me. The avifile-command also made some trouble for me, so I decided to implement the VideoWriter approach. For older Matlab versions, I still need to implement the avifile approach, which basically works exactly the same (call getframe, then call addframe instead of writeVideo)


           x implement non-interactive mode (just play the movie, then close the window,
          return a image-matrix if desired/cfg.recording='yes')

          This is implemented as cfg.interactive, if 'no' the video will just be saved and then the function quits. If no datafile name to be written is given, a save dialog appears, asking for location and filename.


          Further, I made the function work on connectivitydata by copying code over from topoplot_common.

          721 $ svn ci private/moviefunction.m -m "enhancement-#1036-recording functionality and compatibility with connectivity data added"
          Sending        private/moviefunction.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 7759.

          example of video recording

          at the moment, the whole figure is recorded. I decided for this because this st*pid getframe function doesn't work well with having different axes. Maybe when rewriting the UI and using 'uilayout', having different axes/panels is not needed anymore.

          snappy

          arrr, just wanted to show what I've done to Cpt. Early Leaver aka JM ... tsss
          well, then no live action but just a snapshot

          still a lot to do, like showing the time course, the colorbar has some bugs and some more consistency checks and code cleaning (it's becoming a mess again because of the multiple input argument handling). also the recording function is not properly checked yet. Still, I committed for testing purposes:

          svn ci moviefunction.m -m "some minor updates + multiple input argument handling implemented"
          Sending        moviefunction.m
          Transmitting file data .
