          i just found a bug in the svn version of fieldtrip.

          line 249 reads:

          sens = ft_datatype_sens(sens);

          this does not work if a ready-made volume is given to function.
          i would thus suggest to write instead:

          if ~isempty(sens)
             sens = ft_datatype_sens(sens);
          end

          i have tested this and it works without a problem. maybe you would have to check whether a cfg.vol has been given to the function....

Instead of locating those and fixing it multiple times, I think it is better to change ft_datatype_sens such that \nft_datatype_sens([])\nalways returns empty.\n\nI can imagine this also being an appropriate strategy to harden the other ft_datatype_xxx functions. \n\nFor the moment I suggest you work with your locally fixed function, I'll discuss it with the local dev team."

          This has been fixed by JM using

          if isempty(sens)
              return;
          end

          It needs discussing whether a similar enhancement is needed for the other ft_datatype_XXX in the utilities dir. For the moment I consider it fixed for this particular bug.

          I thought that we discussed in the FT-meeting that the other ft_datatype_xxx functions need to be changed, too.

          I fixed this one, because I stumbled upon it during my own analysis and forgot to whom the bug was assigned ;-)

          Ok, added the ability to deal with empty input to those functions

          .. and redid the change to ft_datatype. Unlike ft_datatype_XXXs, ft_datatype does already handle the lack of data for input. Namely, it labels the datatype as 'unknown'.
