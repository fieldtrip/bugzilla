        thetext: this only happens if you read only the very last sample. If you read more, it will not be zero.

          This is indeed the case, but the issue is more generic. If in general just a single sample of data is asked, ft_read_data returns all zeros.

          This can be traced back to line 213 in fiff_read_raw_segment. Data is only assigned to the output if picksamp>0, i.e. if more than a single sample is requested. Changing the '>' into '>=' would solve it.

          @Alex: do you see a principled reason to keep it '>' rather than to change it into '>='? (apart from the fact that it is a bit silly to ask only for a single sample of data...) If not, we probably would want to make this change also in the mne-matlab code.

          no objection to change this in the mne-matlab code

          can you open a pull request on github?

          thanks
