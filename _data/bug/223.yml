          I've been playing around with the peer toolbox a bit. I know it's still being actively worked on so I hope this is useful.

          The peer toolbox no longer launches on my system. I believe the last version of peer that work is from November 5, 2010 (however it's really slow to get the jobs out to the slaves).

          Here's what I did with fieldtrip-20101115: I added the root fieldtrip directory to my path, ran fieldtripdefs, and then added fieldtrip-20101115/peer to my path. Running peermaster produces this error (peerslave gives a similar problem):

          ===============================
          >> peermaster
          peer: init
          ??? Error using ==> peer
          unknown command for peer

          Error in ==> peerinfo at 29
          info = peer('peerinfo');

          Error in ==> peermaster at 80
          info   = peerinfo;
          ===============================

          I can see that peer/private/peer.m exists, but even if it were to execute properly it would just call "error('cannot locate mex file');"

          Thanks for the instructions. peercompile in matlab worked fine. Despite 'make' throwing a few errors at the command line, running a peermaster/peerslave and a peercellfun job like the pinv call on the "how to get started" page works fine. However, it's still way slower than just running cellfun with the pinv example, even when making a = randn(2000,2000) (76 seconds vs 325 seconds). Is that because it has to load the data into memory for each job? Or maybe there are other subtleties that I'm not realizing.

          Anyway, here is the command line output from 'make' in case that is useful:

          Dr. Oostenveld,

          You know much more about the peer toolbox than I do, but I just thought I would add that this resolution seems reasonable to me, and I hope that there are instructions somewhere (the wiki? or maybe fieldtrip/peer/README?) explaining that, for each potential peermaster and peerslave computer, one might need to (1) run peercompile in MATLAB, (2) run make in fieldtrip/peer/src/ after modifying MATLABPATH in the Makefile to correctly reflect where the MATLAB application is located, and (3) similarly modify MATLABPATH in fieldtrip/peer/peerslave so that LD_LIBRARY_PATH gets set properly.
