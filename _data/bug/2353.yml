          It seems this was implemented in r11035 and r11039 but there are still mentions of the old syntax in, eg, fileio/ft_read_data.m and ft_scalingfactor.m itself:
          fieldtrip/fileio/ft_read_data.m:
          l.1345:  scaling = cellfun(@scalingfactor, hdr.chanunit(chanindx(:)), chanunit(:));
          fieldtrip/utilities/ft_scalingfactor.m:
          l.92:  factor = cellfun(@scalingfactor, old(:), new(:));

          Sorry, I forgot to mention the commit here.

          My grep missed them. The fieldtrip/compat/scalingfactor.m function should catch it, but of course needs to be fixed.

          (In reply to Guillaume from comment #1)

          I just noticed that I forgot to add this one to the release (although I mentioned it in a previous comment). That caused Guillame noticing that it was renamed. I'll still add it, just to be sure.
