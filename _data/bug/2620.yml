        thetext: "There is a piece of code that plots the outline on line 391. This is not conditional on the cfg. Subsequently, on line 582 the outline is plotted once more in case show outline=yes.\n\nTineke conformed having seen cartoon heads in ERFs during the last 2 years, although according to the cfg.showoutline default there should not be any. Also the plotting tutorial has a figure without outline.\n\nI traced it down to \nhttps://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=3694\nwhich was on 15 June 2011."

          I adjusted the behavior of ft_mulitplotER to be the same like the on of ft_multiplotTFR with respect to cfg.showoutline.
