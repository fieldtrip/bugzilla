          Dear FieldTrip friends,
          I am using parallel processing with Matlab2011b and I encountered the following bug in the function qsubcellfun:
          Error in qsubeval (line 486)
             result_words = strsplit(result);

          Which points to the fact that the function has not been found.

          I dug a useful patch out of the internet (BSD licence) that solves the problem for me, if I add it to the path:

          http://www.mathworks.de/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21710-string-toolkits/content/strings/strsplit.m

          Maybe a useful solution for users of Matlab versions previous to 2013?

          All the best,
          Cristiano

          Hi Cristiano

          strsplit seems to do the same thing as the (much older) fieldtrip tokenize function is doing, i.e. cut a string on the basis of a delimiter. Thus I have replaced the call by  tokenize.
