          Since the input variables of the preproc-function have been changed a bit, the ft_artifact_threshold stopped working.
          The error is encountered on line 407 of preproc. The error message says, that an index of an array has to be a positive integer or logical value.

          As I found out, the preproc-function is called inside ft_artifact_threshold with "cfg.trl(trlop,3)" as the fifth parameter. In earlier versions this was needed as the offset-variable, but now it is treated by preproc as "begpadding". In my case is cfg.trl(trlop,3)=-180, which led me to this problem.

          Hi MrJay,

          Thanks for the report! For some reason I forgot to remove the offset from the function call, which now automatically served as 'begpadding'. It is now fixed and will be online on the FTP server tonight. You can easily fix it in your current version by removing the last input argument to the preproc call (the "cfg.trl(trlop,3)"), which serves no purpose anymore.

          Cheers,
          Roemer
