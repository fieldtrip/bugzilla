        thetext: A student at the toolkit pointed out to me that ft_volumenormalise used cfg.coordinates in the help-section comments, but in fact in the code, cfg.coordsys was used (and 'coordinates' was correspondingly checked as deprecated).  I changed the comments to reflect coordsys, which I presume is the current/best way to call this variable.  (coordsys makes more intuitive sense to me than coordinates for this option)

          I fixed it in github, branch bug2114 on oostenveld/fieldtrip, which I subsequently pulled into fieldtrip/master.

          There is still a bug here, it cannot load the headshape from a fif file and gives this error:


          ??? SWITCH expression must be a scalar or string constant.

          Error in ==> ft_read_headshape at 306
              switch coordinates


          I think you need to change:

          'coordinates' to 'coordsys' in lines 164 and 306

          There is a bug here after the modification, I get this error:

          ??? SWITCH expression must be a scalar or string constant.

          Error in ==> ft_read_headshape at 446
                switch coordinates


          I guess at the beginning of the file (lines 92, 93 and 98-104), we should swap 'coordsys' and 'coordiantes'?

          There is something weird happening with this function. I fixed this bug in rev #8071 and now it reappeared again. Looking at the log I see that in rev #8193 irisim made extensive changes to the function and reinstated the old code. Judging from the accompanying comment I doubt it was intentional. It looks like this user accidentally checked in a much older version of the code and overwrote the more recent one. Then there were some more changes so I think someone should carefully go through the logs and sort this mess out. Also I would recommend reminding the developers to do SVN update and making sure the differences between their working version and the repository version are just what was intended before checking in any code.

          I don't think it's that simple, that's why I didn't do it myself. I don't know what other changes where overwritten in that commit #8193. It looks like the differences were all over the place.

        thetext: I think it is not as bad as it looks. Irina's changes were related to dealing with cortical sheets represented in more than one file (freesurfer/caret style). In the googlecode diff it seems that a lot of 'difference' was just shifting line numbers etc. The reverted change causing the crash was really only the coordsys changing back into coordinates in the switch statements.

        thetext: OK. If you checked then I'm happy. Still explaining the developers the checks that need to be done before checking something in might be a good idea.

          As far as I am concern it is fine now.
