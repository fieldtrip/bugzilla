          Hi all,

          on the FieldTrip wiki (in faq and reference documentation), I can find two links to brain atlases:

          http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/doc/misc/ttatlas_tlrc

          This links gives an error.


          http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/

          And on this website, it is not clear how I could download an atlas. It seems to me as if I could download only the full software, and not individual files for an atlas.

          Could someone help me to make these links a bit more specific in the documentation? thanks!

          Lilla

          I have found the right link to the afni atlas:
          http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/doc/misc/afni_ttatlas/

          can I correct it in reference docu of ft_volumelookup:

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/reference/ft_volumelookup

          and in ft_prepare_atlas?

          But regarding that ft_prepare_atlas should be re-placed by ft_read_atlas, this latest is not really important (see bug1725).

          and for the other link: Can we say that the wfu atlases can be found in the spm toolbox?

          and correction would be useful also in FAQ:

          I just close this bug, because the links are changed now to the actual download page of the afni atlas.
