          Hi Alexandre,

          Would you mind renaming /fieldtrip/external/mne/tests into /fieldtrip/external/mne/test (without the "s") for consistency with other fieldtrip test directories?

          thanks
          R

          PS I don't mind doing it myself, but just want to check that it is ok with you
