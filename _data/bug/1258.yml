          Hi Vadim and Ana,

          I have tried to reproduce the bug you report, but everything seems to work fine on my end. It might be that something changed inthe handling of the mex-files recently, could you check whether you still get the bug in the latest version of Fieldtrip? The simplest test is probably just to execute something like:

          >> cd H:/common/matlab/fieldtrip/private
          >> w=solid_angle([1 2 3],[1 2 3],[1 2 3])

          w =

               0
          >> which solid_angle
          H:\common\matlab\fieldtrip\private\solid_angle.mexw64  % Private to fieldtrip

          Please also include the 'which' statement, the output from that might be relevant to the issue.

          No it seems working for me as well.
          So, you can close the bug, I think.

          Hi,

          I am sorry but it didn't work for me..

          I get the same error message:

          Invalid MEX-file 'C:\Program Files\fieldtrip-20120304\private\solid_angle.mexw64': The specified module could not be found.

          Error in bounding_mesh (line 71)
              solang = solid_angle(tmp, tri);

          Error in ft_prepare_sourcemodel (line 693)
              tmp = bounding_mesh(grid.pos, pnt, tri);

          Error in ft_prepare_leadfield (line 164)
          grid = ft_prepare_sourcemodel(tmpcfg);

          I also try what you told me:


          w=solid_angle([1 2 3],[1 2 3],[1 2 3])

          but I got again the error message:

          Invalid MEX-file 'C:\Program Files\fieldtrip-20120304\private\solid_angle.mexw64': The specified module could not be found.

          I'm working with the fieldtrip-20120304 version.

          Thanks.

          Greetings,

          Thank you both for the feedback.

          @Vadim: good to hear that it works for you :)

          @Ana Sofia: I will look into why you are still having trouble. It could be a specific dependency not being found by a particular Matlab version. What matlab version are you using?

          Hi guys/girls,
          I think I probably have a clue. In fact, I did not download the newest build, but only tested the one that originally had not work for me. Now, all of a sudden, it started to work. Given that I do not believe it magic, something changed in my environment. What came to my mind that recently I struggled with libsvm mex file, which also refused to run. I think the reason was similar to this one. The problem was that some matlab dll was missing from Windows PATH definition (system variable environment in Control Panel). As a result the mex file was missing required dependency. This can be easily tracked by using this tool: http://www.dependencywalker.com/
          My guess is that updating the path also fixed the fieldtrip issue.
          Here is the path I have now:
          C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2009b\runtime\win64;C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2009b\bin;C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2009b\bin\win64
          It seems that I was missing the last one. Clearly, all we are using 64-bit matlab.
          So, Ana, I suggest that you try to check in this direction.

          Ana, it could be that you are missing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 runtime, which (unfortunately) is required by this particular MEX-file. You can download this runtime from: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=5555

          Could you let me know if this solves the issue for you? (Or perhaps has Vadim's suggestion already solved it?)

          We are trying to think of a way to remove the linkage of our mex-files to the MSVC runtime DLLs, but this proves to be quite difficult.
