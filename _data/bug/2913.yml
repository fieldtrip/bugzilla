          There is a typo at l.49 of ft_getopt.c: mxErrMsgTxt() instead of mexErrMsgTxt().

          R2015b beta considers the MEX-file as invalid:

          >> ft_getopt
          Invalid MEX-file

          I recently moved th eft_compile_mex helper function to utilities, and it needed a small fix for the changed path.

          I recompiled ft_getopt for maci64

          Instead of the error 'undefined symbol: mxErrMsgTxt', I receive this error in the new 2015b release (Windows 7 & 10, 64bit):

          Invalid MEX-file '~\fieldtrip\utilities\ft_getopt.mexw64': The specified
          procedure could not be found.

          To test for mex compiling, I've run 'ft_compile_mex' without error.

          Hi Korey,

          The ft_compile_mex function compiles all files but does not yet put them in the right place. That means that the old mex files are still taking precedence.

          You should delete all existing mex files (on the basis of the file extension) and then put the newly compiled ones in a directory on your path. I.e. they dnot have to be in private, anywhere on your path is fine.

          Hope this helps.

          Now that 2015b is out, I might be able to get it from our IT department. I will ask. @Guillaume: how did you arrange to get pre-releases?

          That helps.

          My first problem was that 2015b did not recognize my prev installed compiler.

          Following this answer resolved it:

          My MathWorks account is linked to the site license - I guess you need to talk to the person administrating the licenses in your institution to be granted access to beta versions.

          There was one issue with R2015b and @xmltree (used by @gifti): you should update the version in FieldTrip (using the dev version of SPM12, or from their respective website).

          Hi Guys,

          I found the cause of the problem. It is not about the compilation but rather the C code per se.
          The problem is that the function "mxErrMsgTxt" is not supported in matlab2015b, we need to replace it with: "mexErrMsgIdAndTxt".
          Given the generality of the defective function, I suppose that this has to be done for almost all the our c codes, but for now I found the problem only in ft_getopt.
          (The new function takes 2 arguments instead of 1)

          Unfortunately it seems that there are some problems of compatibility between 2012b and 2015b. The ft_getopt mex file that I compiled for 2015b gives the following error in 2012b:

          "mexGetVariableWithObject"

          Luca - the problem was a typo that only affected ft_getopt.c (mxErrMsgTxt -> mexErrMsgTxt). It was fixed in June (commit 10480). Since the problem was initially reported on a Mac, only the Mac binary was recompiled.

          So at the moment just the ft_getopt.mexa64 needs to be recompiled for this issue.
