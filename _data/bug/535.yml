          I specifically wrote about and attached wavelet data, but this also applies to ft_freqanalysis data with cfg.method='mtmconvol'. After running mtmconvol data through ft_connectivityanalysis, data_conn has the exact same structure as I posted about for the wavelet data.

          Also, for both wavelet and mtmconvol, I set cfg.keeptrials='no' and cfg.keeptapers='no' because subjects are my units of observation.

Once the plv is computed the trials become irrelevant"

          I will definitely check on it when today's version is on the FTP server (I thought I could immediately get the changes with a public SVN checkout <http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/checkout>, but I don't see the addition of the 'exact' argument yet.) Also, Matlab 7.11 tells me that strmatch will be removed in future versions. Might be a good idea to use strcmp instead.

          I'm confused about your comment that I need to specify cfg.keeptrials='yes' with powandcsd data. Dr. Maris wrote in this thread <http://mailman.science.ru.nl/pipermail/fieldtrip/2010-September/003086.html> that one could use cfg.keeptrials='no' for a within-subjects analysis (and using less RAM/disk would be ideal). This seems to make sense because the crsspctrm is already computed in ft_freqanalysis for all combinations of channels (8256 in my case). Am I missing something here?


          Related to this, it seems that with 'fourier' memory requirements will only be slightly increased in ft_freqanalysis because keeptrials='yes' (one spectrum per electrode per trial), but even more memory will be required when using ft_connectivityanalysis because it computes the cross-spectra between sensors for every trial and every frequency (there's no keeptrials='no' option here). So, if I want to keep memory usage down, I was thinking I should use powandcsd, while fourier will always require lots of RAM. Does that reasoning make sense?

          Quick followup.

          I just tried keeptrials='yes' and keeptapers='yes' an I get an error in ft_frequanalysis (line 319) that I can only set both to 'yes' if I'm doing fourier output.

          I then tried keeptrials='yes' and keeptapers='no' and it has brought my computer (one-year-old Mac Pro with 14GB of RAM) to its knees. If keeptrials='yes' is required to do connectivity analyses, is that to be expected? I can't imagine lots of people have access to computers with that much RAM. I was planning on submitting this to a computer cluster that has 2GB of ram per node (running 1 subject per node), but that does not seem like a viable option when 14GB was maxed out for a few minutes after processing the first trial.

          I've verified that the bug is fixed for ft_singleplotTFR and ft_topoplotTFR with the addition of the 'exact' match in strfind. I didn't check the ft_*plotER functions.

          However, I don't think I ever tried ft_multiplotTFR before, but trying it now get a weird plot. I only get 2 channels (labeled E1 and E1), not plv/TF plots of all channels using the cohrefchan as the reference. I used the same data_conn that I attached and this cfg_ft:

          cfg_ft = [];
          cfg_ft.xparam = 'time';
          cfg_ft.yparam = 'freq';
          cfg_ft.zparam = 'plvspctrm';
          cfg_ft.cohrefchannel = {'E3'};
          cfg_ft.channel = 'all';
          cfg_ft.xlim = [0.5 0.8]; % time
          cfg_ft.ylim = [3 8]; % freq
          cfg_ft.zlim = [0 1]; % spctrm
          cfg_ft.elecfile='GSN-HydroCel-129.sfp';
          cfg_ft.layout = ft_prepare_layout(cfg_ft);
          cfg_ft.showlabels = 'yes';
          cfg_ft.colorbar = 'yes';
          cfg_ft.showoutline = 'yes';
          figure
          ft_multiplotTFR(cfg_ft,data_conn);




          I'm still curious about the other questions I posted. I'd be happy to take that discussion elsewhere (I can reply to the email you sent on the list) if this bug report isn't the right place. Let me know.

          Thanks,
          Matt

          I know I've made a lot of activity on here recently, and I promise this is the last email you'll get from me today! :-)

          I thought it was interesting enough to note that ft_multiplotTFR successfully plots connectivity data when cfg.output='fourier' in ft_freqanalysis, using both wavelets and multitapers. (the issue in comment 6 was specifically with powandcsd.)

          It really seems like fourier output is the way to go, but I don't know how to reshape it to represent the nchoosek(129,2)=8256 channel combinations when size(data_conn.plvspctrm)=129   129     9    33.
          If I do
          siz = size(data_conn.plvspctrm);
          size(reshape(data_conn.plvspctrm,siz(1)*siz(2),siz(3),siz(4)))
          ans = 16641           9          33

          and (16641-129)/2 = 8256
          so it seems that ft_connectivityanalysis is producing duplicate channel combinations (i.e., 'E1_E2' and 'E2_E1' when those should be equal) plus auto-correlations?

          Anyway, goodnight!
