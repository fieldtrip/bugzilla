          I'm interested in finding the latency when the response in a specific
          ROI shows significant difference between conditions (e.g. test whether
          the difference in V1 activity originates from early feedforward response
          or later feedback response).

          I guess we can manually run t-test on the single-trial timecourse at
          each source location, but need to deal with the multiple-comparisons
          problem. It would be great if we can set cfg.cfg.parameter = 'mom' for
          ft_sourcestatistics, but the current version doesn't seem to support this.
