          Newer files cannot be imported properly (read_eep_cnt crashes).

          Version currently in fileio: libeep-3.3.167
          Version currently distributed by ANT: libeep-3.3.173
          https://www.ant-neuro.com/support/supporting-documentation-and-downloads

          Just updating the library fixes the problem.

          Hi Francois,

          You mean that we should update fieldtrip/external/eeprobe to the files that can be downloaded from their site?

          Do you have a demo file in the new format?

          ANT has ben notoriously bad in supporting this. I initially (long time ago when the company was just started) wrote the mex wrappers and donated them to ANT under a BSD license. Since then, it keeps getting back on my plate to support their data. The consequence is that I am not too enthusiastic about supporting it any more, also because we don't have their systems in Nijmegen.

          Example file:
          https://www.dropbox.com/s/k3n7x9wa2g4v1vm/ANT_newfiles.zip?dl=0

          There is not much to do, just download the new mex files (maybe just read_eep_cnt):
          http://download.ant-neuro.com/matlab/

          I guess they linked your old mex code against their new libeep library.
          The associated .m files still say "Copyright 2002, Robert Oostenveld" :)
