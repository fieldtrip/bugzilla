          As you mentioned [at Biomag], it would indeed be great to be able to do import/export operations between Fieldtrip and Elan.

          Can you please send me some guidelines and information that could be useful to help me write the code to import ELAN data into fieldtrip and possibly export FieldTrip data into an ELAN format.

        thetext: "Hi Pierre-Emmanuel,\n\nSorry for t he delay in following this up. Your suggestion sounds like a good plan.\n\nIn the ELAN documentation I see \"The first step consists in converting your own continuous EEG or MEG data files to the ELAN internal format. Thereafter, all processing will only concern files in ELAN format (continuous data files [.eeg files], average responses [.p files], trigger position [.pos files], time-frequency data [.tf files], â€¦).\" \nWould all of these file formats then be covered?\n\nOnce you have the two functions, could you also provide a test file like \n\ntest_elan.m\nfilename = {\nsomedata.eeg\notherdata.p\n...}\nfor i=1:length(filename)\n data = elan2fieldtrip(filename{i});   % read from disk\n elan2fieldtrip(['output_' filename{i}], data); % write back\nend\n\nand send that to us together with the data? If I can confirm that the functions work as expected, then I'll add the code to fieldtrip.\n\nthanks\nRobert"

          Hi Robert,
          After a long delay (I'm sorry), I finished the 2 functions elan2fieldtrip.m and fieldtrip2elan.m .
          These 2 functions can import/export continuous data, evoked potentials or averaged data, and time-frequency data. They call 6 other functions (private) : read_elan_eeg.m, write_elan_eeg.m, read_elan_ep.m, write_elan_ep, read_elan_tf.m and write_elan_tf.m . I attach these 8 matlab files as elan_fieldtrip.tar.gz .
          I also attach data files with a test file test_elan.m as test_elan_data.tar.gz
