          hmm, I am getting confused with what cfg.projectmom is doing. Would you mind explaining that to me?

          Other weird things I noticed:

           - the keepcsd option is seemingly supported, but apparently the csd is computed anyway and then just dropped in the end.

           - if not keeptrials then keepcsd is used to also specify whether the noisecsd should be kept

           - cfg.supmethod seems to have something to do with noisecsd, but is not further documented

          Should I got and make this all nicer or just implement a blunt and straightforward solution given that we will have a new source* implementation anyways soon?
