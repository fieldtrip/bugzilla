        thetext: this is because the cumtapcnt field is incorrectly created. This is an important bug because subsequent code relies on this field

          Hi JM,
          I thought I had it correctly implemented based on the old code, but I must have missed something. What are supposed to be the correct dimensions of the field? Then I'll re-implement it in a proper way.

        thetext: It should now produce a correct cumtapcnt. For the moment, it's a split solution for mtmconvol (ntrialsXnfoi) and mtmfft (ntrialsX1). Cumtapcnt is not created for the other methods. Perhaps it would be best to think of a solution/representation that is equal for all of the freq methods (which can only be done if the other functions are 'specested').
