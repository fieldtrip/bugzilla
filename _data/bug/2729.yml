        thetext: "Hi Caroline\n\nyou can get btsync from http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/download\n\nit works similar to dropbox, except that you can have an arbitrary number of folders, which you share between an arbitrary number of machines (e.g. between your own desktop and laptop, or with others like me). It runs in the background like dropbox, but only syncs between computers and not into the cloud. That also means that there needs to be some overlap in time in the computers being switched on and connected to the internet, otherwise the data could not be transferred. \n\nYou would first make a directory/folder, then go into btsync and add a new \"folder to share\". At that moment you have to either enter the \"secret\" of the folder (in case someone else is already sharing it), or you make a new secret for the folder. I would need that secret (don't post it here!). There will be a read-only secret and a full-access secret. With the full-access secret, I can go into my btsync and synchronise a folder on my computer with the folder on your computer. \n\nThere is no account involved, only the shared secret, which is a string like ALQSHTDZZLIHYPKAX64J557ZCATU.\n\nSynching works fine and is fast. Dealing with conflicts and keeping backups of files is in my experience not as robust as dropbox, but good enough. We used it also for the NatMEG workshop, sharing all course material (slides, data, scripts, administrative documents) and have been using it in the past to distribute data to workshop participants."

          Hi Robert,

          I've shared a link via your gmail account to a BitTorrent Sync folder on my laptop which has data from the same subject on a CTF system and an Elekta system - should have localisable spikes for a Kurtosis beamformer.  It just gave me a link to send, let me know if this does not work.

          The coregistered MRI (in CTF .mri format) for the CTF data is in there, but I have not copied the DICOM files across yet because I haven't got a method for anonymising them which also preserves the format.  Can you suggest a method for this?

          Let me know if you have any problems accessing the data (it's on my laptop, which is currently connected via wifi but which I'll plug into a wired connection on Monday if the syncing speed is slow). Its about 1G total.

          best wishes
          Caroline
