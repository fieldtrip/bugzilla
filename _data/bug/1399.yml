          I got told that you have to select channels according to the number of the channel, but it displays the channel label, which makes it hard to unselect a channel again, because you have to guess the number by looking at the imagesc plot on the upper left
          I did not test whether this is true, but I might forget it if I make no bug out of this ;)

          simple solution could be that you could also input a string instead of a number, and that unselected channels will get an index, something like MRP42(136)
