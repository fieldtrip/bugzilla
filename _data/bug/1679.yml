          line 202 of ft_prepare_headmodel allows the use of singleshell and singlesphere without the cfg.tissue being specified. It seems like localspheres should also be included in this list.

          If there is a reason that localspheres should require this parameter, the documentation should be changed to reflect that.

          Hi,

          The ft_prepare_headmodel has gone through a re-organization recently. And I have just checked in the code, and localsphere is supposed to work now in the same way as singleshell and singlesphere. But all these methods will work without tissue being specified if the fields representing the tissues are named 'brain','skin','scalp','csf'.... (according to the output of ft_volumesegment).

          I close this bug, but I would be happy to know if you think the bug has been not solved.
