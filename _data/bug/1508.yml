          When calling ft_freqanalysis with channel names (in cfg.channel) that do not exist in the data, an error is only produced when ft_freqanalysis is analysing the second trial (so, not right from the first trial):

          the input is raw data with 286 channels and 101 trials
          processing trials
          trial 1, frequency 61 (60.00 Hz), 3 tapers??? Error using ==> reshape
          To RESHAPE the number of elements must not change.

          Error in ==> ft_freqanalysis at 640
          spectrum = reshape(permute(spectrum_mtmconvol(:,:,freqtapind{ifoi}),[3 1 2]),[ntaper(ifoi) nchan 1 ntoi]);

          For reproducability, I've put a dataset and m-file in /home/common/temporary/4FT.

        thetext: generally, uploading stuff to /home/common/temporary is not a good idea, because it is not guaranteed that anybody will fetch the data from there before it 'expires'. Please upload at least the script/cfg to the bugzilla website. If it is a general problem, the thing should be reproducible on any MEG dataset.

          Hey Stan,

          I fixed it by throwing an error when cfg.channel is empty. Can you check an verify with your data/script again? If the error persists, let me know and I'll get back to this issue again.

          Sending        ft_freqanalysis.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 6218.
