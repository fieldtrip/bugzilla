        thetext: When ft_rejectvisual is called using cfg.keepchannel = 'yes' and cfg.channel is not 'all', it is supposed to keep all channels but only use those channels that were selected for plotting. Unfortunately, only those channels that were selected are kept and the others removed.

All channels in the input should be available in the output. \n\nAt this point cfg.keepchannel is used in the code to decide what to do with the channels that are marked as bad. If we wish this option to reflect what to do with channels that are not selected by cfg.channel, then we need to add another function that reflects what to do with marked channels as two decisions need to be made: what to do with unselected input channels and what to do with channels marked as 'bad'."

          Hi Robert,

          The reason I added cfg.reject is because cfg.keepchannel also decided what would happen with channels that you actually want to remove (line 326 onwards). In your current implementation, if you have cfg.keepchannel ='yes', you cannot remove channels anymore, even if you mark them for rejection in the summary view. This is because input channels that are not selected with cfg.channel are treated as channels that are marked in the summary view. I do not believe this is what we want.

          Naturally I thought it should be possible to keep the input channels that were not specified with cfg.channel and still be able to reject channels. I therefore implemented cfg.reject to deal with the marked channels and have cfg.keepchannel only handle the input channels.
