        thetext: "sourceanalysis does tic at the beginning and at the end it does\nfprintf('total time in sourceanalysis %.1f seconds\\n', toc);\n\nIf the user also uses tit/toc in his script, then this will mess it up. Therefore all fieldtrip usage of tic/toc should read\n\nstopwatch = tic;\nfprintf('total time in sourceanalysis %.1f seconds\\n', toc(stopwatch));\n\ni.e. use an explicit name of the tic/toc timer. \n\nTODO this has to be fixed in sourceanalysis, probably also in componentanalysis \nTODO check all fieldtrip functions for the use of tic/toc (with grep) and fix it everywhere"
