          I downgraded the 'importance' of this bug, because I would say that the classification 'blocker' implies that nothing works anymore.

          Could you please try and debug a bit more yourself and provide a solution. It seems from the assortativity code that some conditional section is bypassed, which I don't understand. Flag should be either 0 or 1. If not, it's a bug in ft_networkanalysis, otherwise the problem lies in assortativity, which is not FieldTrip's responsibility, but bct's

        thetext: "Hi, the bct function (assortativity.m) is working fine on its own, and flag (0 or 1) is definitely reaches it. I was unable to trace the issue. \nI have a feeling that some mistake is in the way how connectivity matrix is handled and all values there are replaced with 0 or NaN at some point."
