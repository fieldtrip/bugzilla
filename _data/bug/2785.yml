        thetext: "i found a critical bug in ft_timelockgrandaverage. basically, if the cfg.latency field is used and the dof field is present in the data, data is always selected from the beginning of the trials.\n\nthe problem is in line 154ff:\n\n  if hastime\n    timesel = nearest(varargin{i}.time, cfg.latency(1)):nearest(varargin{i}.time, cfg.latency(2));\n    varargin{i}.time = varargin{i}.time(timesel);\n  end\n  \n  if hasdof\n    timesel = nearest(varargin{i}.time, cfg.latency(1)):nearest(varargin{i}.time, cfg.latency(2));\n    varargin{i}.dof = varargin{i}.dof(chansel,timesel);\n  end\n\nin line 156, the original time field is modified according to the latency. in line 160, this altered field is used for a new time selection. this leads to a mismatch because the time field is already cut while the rest of the data is not.\n\ni would suggest using the well tested ft_selectdata function instead.\ni would also be willing to fix the bug using ft_selectdata if you think it is the right way to go.\n\nplease let me know as soon as possible because this bug leads to wrong results and should be fixed asap.\n\nbest,\nthomas"

          I can confirm the problem and wrote a test script for it (which is presently failing with an error).

          Committed revision 10053.

          I agree that ft_selectdata should be used for a consistent selection of all fields of the input data. Please go ahead and improve the code.

          You might want to review/rerun the relevant test scripts during the rewrite to make sure that existing functionality remains intact.

          (In reply to Thomas Hartmann from comment #2)

          sorry, that was something I fixed on the fly, but forgot to commit. It had to do with estimating sample from the first trial, which has length 1.

          mac011> svn commit utilities/ft_datatype_raw.m ft_timelockanalysis.m

          Transmitting file data ..
          Committed revision 10054.

          regarding the other tests: if they involve data that is on disk, then you don't have to bother. I was hoping that there would be some test scripts that start with some data that is generated on the fly.
