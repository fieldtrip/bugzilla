Every channel is a almost a flat line and you always have to zoom in before using. \n\nI propose to automatically decrease the default scaling when viewmode is vertical, by a factor of 10 (works nicely for me).\nJM and Jorn, as it's a default, could you give a short no or yes on whether this also works nicely for you?\n\nIf you input cfg.develscalefix = 'yes' it uses the default I semi-randomly picked.\n\nOn line 362 you can find the factor I used to adjust if you want to try it out."

          Not quite sure (didn't test though, yet). Some questions to think about though:
           - Is it useless when using continuous data or segmented data? Is the scaling for segmented data done on the maxabs of all trials or only the current trial?

           - Is it for EEG or MEG data (#channels)?


          I'm gonna check with my (i)EEG and MEG data and let you know. Is this high priority?

          It is of extremely low priority ;). It just annoyed me that I was pressing shift+up a number of times every time I opened a databrowser, and realized I wasn't the only one probably.

          I updated the priority accordingly ;)

          Minor comment:
          The scaling is useless whenever the viewmode is vertical I think. It is also not caused by doing a maxabs (which I am talking about) on only part of the data (which is true), the silly issue is caused because there is currently no overlap allowed for channel time-courses, such that each one has it's own white-space to fully use. When viewing time-courses above each other though, it makes sense for them to overlap moderately, otherwise, you mainly see white space, instead of time-courses :)
          EEG/MEG shouldn't matter, the above would be the same for all. Hell, it would even hold for the social sciences time-series ;). Whether continuous is yes or no doesn't matter as well.
