        thetext: "I'm quite out of my depth here as to why exactly the following happens, and if its my fault(and problem) or not, but here it is anyway:\n\nI have sourcedata from pcc (from freqanalysis, method = 'fourier') which has mom and csd:\n\nsource = \n         csd: {1x21819 cell}\n    noisecsd: {1x21819 cell}\n         mom: {1x21819 cell}\n      filter: {1x21819 cell}\n    csdlabel: {'scandip'  'scandip'  'scandip'}\n\nNow I want to have pow values returned by sourcedescriptives. If I do the following:\n\n    cfg             = [];\n    cfg.powmethod   = 'regular';\n    cfg.keeptrials  = 'yes';\n    source_temp{i}  = ft_sourcedescriptives(cfg,source);  \n\nI get the following error:\n\nthe input is source data with 21819 positions\ncomputing singletrial voxel-level cross-spectral densities [--------------\\]\ncomputing singletrial voxel-level power [-|                                ]???

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

          It's been so long, and had so much fun with you since, that I won't be pressing charges. :)

          Closed the bug.
