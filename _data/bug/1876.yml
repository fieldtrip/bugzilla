          this was brought up by Frederic in an email on the fieldtrip list.

          I think it should be relatively straight forward to implement a test script and proper support for this (as we already know how to deal with some Caret formats).

          The data is here
          http://sumsdb.wustl.edu/sums/directory.do?id=6585200&dir_name=CARET_TUTORIAL_SEPT-06

          TODO in steps
          - download the data and copy to home/common
          - figure out which file to start with (there is a whole bunch)
          - write a test script that calls ft_read_atlas and/or ft_read_headshape
          - ensure that the output is consistent with the parcellation datatype

          Along the way: implement all the stuff that needs to be done (e.g. ft_filetype and ft_read_xxx).

        thetext: Pals B12 has been 'replaced' by Conte69. Since the directory layout of the Pals B12 package is so messy, I suggest to leave this be. Conte69 can in principle be handled (but data itself is not released along with fieldtrip).
