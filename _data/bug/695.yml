          To plot the results of the mne source reconstruction we have the following function available:

          - ft_sourcemovie: this function shows the activation on the source-space. it would be nice to see the same also on the inflated surface, for example

        thetext: The inflated surface in itself is supported, the only thing that needs to be done is to replace the source.pos with the pos from the corresponding inflated surface. Should we build in some intelligence, or should we leave this to the user?
