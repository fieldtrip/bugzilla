          Basically, when trying to select a subset of trials in a source structure.

          subset = ft_selectdata(source, 'rpt', [1:100]) for example

          is problematic when trying to reshaping in 'seloverdim', error:

          To RESHAPE the number of elements must not change, line 102

          tmp{j} = reshape(tmp{j},reduceddim{i})

          Hey cap/JM,

          Is ft_selectdata still under construction?

          Note to self: this functionality is not in ft_selectdata_old/_new. It does not make too much sense to implement it in ft_selectdata_old, I think.

          Order of things:
          -deprecate ft_selectdata_old
          -implement it in ft_selectdata_new.

          In other words, this one has to wait a bit.

          I implemented a test script for a source structure with pow as numeric array and as cell-array. With the upcoming format of the source representation and ft_selectdata_newer it now works.
