          Given the nice EDA meeting on this topic, i suggest we update some of the wiki material.

          Important pages
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/what_kind_of_filters_can_i_apply_to_my_data
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/determine_the_filter_characteristics
          and other pages with the tag "filter".

          Should we move the example to faq?

          We should extend the documentation to all filters, also bandstop.

          Where should we document which ft fucntions have ilt options? Which ones have cfg.preproc? I know of datbrowser, timelockanalysis, the artifact detection functions...

        thetext: "Good idea. Extending the FAQs seems logical, but considering the average depth and specificity of the FAQs, maybe it would make more sense to do it as example script. But at the same time, describing filters is more of an answer to a question than an example... \n\nHowever, there are so many gems in the example script section, that maybe it's a good idea to think of reframing it? It feels we are underselling many of the things in there. Let's discuss in the meeting? \n\nRegardless, looking at the other 'example scripts', it would make more sense to do an elaborate one on filtering in that section."

        thetext: "This kind of ended on the forgotten list.\n\nAs it happens to be, I'm writing a short entry on filtering together with JM in a new online Springer Encyclopedia thing (JM was invited and kindly co-invited me ;)). It should end up about 600-1800 words, and be largely based on what I outlined in the EDA meeting. Submission deadline is in June. \n\nWhen there is a final version there, I propose I will make a FAQ on filtering, referring very often to the above piece, and talk about how it's implemented in FieldTrip."
