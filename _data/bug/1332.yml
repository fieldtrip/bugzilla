          Some time ago I made plots like this:

          diftfr = ds{condition(1)}.tfr;   %% .tfr contains results from ft_freqanalysis that keeps trials, dimord: 'rpt_chan_freq_time'
          diftfr.powspctrm = (squeeze(mean(ds{condition(1)}.tfr.powspctrm)) - squeeze(mean(ds{condition(2)}.tfr.powspctrm)) ) ./ (squeeze(mean(ds{condition(1)}.tfr.powspctrm)) + squeeze(mean(ds{condition(2)}.tfr.powspctrm)) ); %% Taking the mean difference scaled by the total
          diftfr.dimord = 'chan_freq_time'; % Changing the dimord

          ft_topoplotER(cfg, diftfr);

          Now, the data is not shown in the plot anymore.

          Hi Linsey,

          Your TFR data contains NaNs. If I remove them with:

          diftfr.powspctrm(isnan(diftfr.powspctrm)) = 0;

          the plotting routine works fine again. However, I am not entirely sure whether this is a problem on your end, or whether the function should actually be able to handle NaNs by itself. I will discuss this with the FT team.
