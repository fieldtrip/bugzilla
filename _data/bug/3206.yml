        thetext: "In the BEM tutorial\nhttp://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/headmodel_eeg_bem\n\nthe output of the segmentation is chosen as\ncfg.output    = {'brain','skull','scalp'};\nsegmentedmri  = ft_volumesegment(cfg, mri);\n\nConsequently, the order of tissues in the later output of ft_prepare_mesh is also brain, skull, scalp. \n\nFrom Figure 4 onwards, however, the tutorial assumes the scalp to be represented in vol.bnd(1) and the brain in vol.bnd(3), while its actually the other way around. This should affect the code for Figure 4, Figure 5, and the electrode alignment.\n\nI wasn't sure enough to edit it directly in the tutorial (dipoli doesn't run on our server), just tell me if I'm correct and I can do the edits."

        thetext: "(In reply to Jens Klinzing from comment #0)\n\nhmm, I recall that there is some reordering of the surfaces. The order is also different for the different MEB methods.\n\nSo after\n\nvol = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, bnd);\n\nit could very well be that the order has changed. So unless you can show otherwise, I assume that the tutorial is actually correct. \n\nYou may want to add a warning that the user should check the order, e.g. in the wiki CMS\n\n<note warning>\nhere goes the warning text.\n</note>"
