        thetext: get 'failure to execute the job (argout)' at unpredictable moments after having submitted a batch of jobs to the peer network. Each job executes the same function, operating on a different file (leading to variable memory requirement). Running the individual (crashed) job locally does not lead to problem. The only thing I can imagine that is happening, is that the machine at which the slave is running goes out of memory, causing the job to crash. is this to be alleviated with setting minmemreq?

        thetext: "I am closing this bug because the development on the fieldtrip/peer toolbox will be put onto hold in favor of the fieldtrip/qsub toolbox. The qsub toolbox is more promising for the DCCN as a whole and hence requires attention. \n\nThe peer toolbox will remain available within fieldtrip, and external contributions to the  code will be considered for inclusion.\n\nIn the future, the development on fieldtrip/peer may be started up again and the bugs that I hereby close as \"wontfix\" can be revisited."
