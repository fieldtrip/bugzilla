          As an example:
          fixtrialdef browses the data.cfg structure for the trl field and then compares if the number of samples per trial is consistent with the length of the data trials. Apart from the fact, that I do not see the point to look for this (but, who knows if this might be needed), this is an incomplete comparison. If the data has been resampled, the ancient cfg.trl does of course not match the current data.

          Fix:
          Line 70 should be changed to something like
          elseif nsmp~=(trl(:,2)-trl(:,1)+1)*(cfg.resamplefs/cfg.origfs) % the latter factor is added due to resampling
