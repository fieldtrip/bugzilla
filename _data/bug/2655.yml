      thetext: "when running a test script yesterday with the (for me default) cfg.trackconfig=on I noticed an error message about \"cfg.trkcfgcount\" in ft_checkdata which was caught in ft_preamble and hence not escalating.\n\nThe specific problem is in configuration tracking, but there might also be something affecting other information that we temporarily store in the cfg, such as the warning_once states.\n\nA specific instance of the problem can be reproduced by adding \nif ~isfield(cfg, 'trkcfgcount'), keyboard; end\ntwice to utilities/ft_checkconfig around line 555.\n\nWhat happens there is that the trkcfgcount field is added to keep track of something (just like some other fields are added elsewhere, e.g. for the warnings). I suspect that those fields get removed/updated/messed-up by the call of an initial high-level FT function to another high-level FT function, followed by the call to rollback_provenance. The consequence is that the initial high-level FT function then looses  that info."
