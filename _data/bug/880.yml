          It is mentioned that "The 2nd and 3rd are the X-position and Y-position", but not which coordinate system they use. It's not the standard Matlab axes-system ( (0,0) bottom left corner; (1,1) top right corner), as I found out by trial-and-error, but which is it? My guess is center = (0,0) and anything fitting within the unit circle is valid, but I don't know and someone who does should document it :)

          Also, while this person is at it, the width/height units should be documented.

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

          (In reply to comment #7)

          Open question: what is the coordinate system of the numbers of the layout file?

          Possible answer: they can be expressed in an arbitrary coordinate system. Once read in, they will be shifted and scaled such that .... [here come details that require a look in the ft_prepare_layout code]. After shifting and scaling, a circle representing the head with nose and ears will be added. This circle has a diameter of ... [again look at code].


          This should be added to the faq.

        thetext: "Agreed.\n\nThe 2-D positions of the electrodes can be expressed in an arbitrary coordinate system. Once read in, they will be shifted and scaled such that they fit within a prespecified x- and y-range ([-0.45 0.45] a.u.). After shifting and scaling, a circle representing the head with nose and ears will be added. This circle has a center (0,0) and radius 0.5 (a.u.). \n\nthe details can be found around line 600 of ft_prepare_layout\n\nand\n\nThe width and height are used for the subplot that will be made in ft_multiplotER and ft_multiplotTFR. The width and height represent 80 and 60% of the smallest 2D electrode position distance respectively."

          please refer to the layout in terms of "channels", not in terms of :"electrodes". In the case of a bipolar channel, there are two electrodes but still a single graph has to be shown.
