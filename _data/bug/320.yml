          when we move the spike functions to contrib this should not be in fieldtrip/private, but in contrib/spike/private, correct?
          I can compile for windows 32 and make autocompilation script but don't have a working version windows 64 for windows with mex utility to compile it

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #3)\n\nIt should indeed move to fieldtrip/contrib/spike/private eventually, but at the moment the appropriate location is fieldtrip/private.\n\nI suggest to move all of ft_spike_sub_crossx to fieldtrip/private for the moment, and in two weeks or so (when contrib is ready) it can be moved to its final location.\n\nSince there is a compiled version for win64 already, there is no actual need to recompile. But please do create an autocompile script. Here is a suggestion (based on the other autocompile scripts)\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nfunction [varargout] = ft_spike_sub_crossx(varargin)\n\n% FT_SPIKE_SUB_CROSSX explain the function\n%\n% Use as\n%   explain the usage\n%\n% Note that this function is implemented as a mex file.
