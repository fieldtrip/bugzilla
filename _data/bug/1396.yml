        thetext: "indeed not very informative. We have had cases like this before, where the only solution was to implement a workaround for a  - in itself syntactically correct - piece of MATLAB code to prevent the crash from happening. \n\nSo I suggest to try and hunt down the crash to a particular piece of code and see whether the crash can be reproduced for that piece in isolation."

        thetext: does it always happen? I encounter such problems usually when there is a memory problem, mostly during a call to a mex-file. An out of memory error should be caught by Matlab, right? So maybe there is something else wrong (I would still bet on a memory issue)

        thetext: I think it happens every time all the tests are run, so probably it is one of the tests that triggers this problem.

          This bug report is too unspecific for us to take over from Boris.
          In general, the bugs on his list that were reassigned to the unassigned-list are not sufficiently documented for us to follow up on. This is a pity.
          The only thing we can do is close them as invalid, unless Boris can infuse them with some of his wisdom, or hopefully even fix them (even if he is not 'officially' on the team anymore).
