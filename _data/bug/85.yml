          "ft_read_sens.m" calls "read_zebris.m", but "read_zebris.m" is not in the corresponding private directory:

          ...
              %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
              % these are created by a Zebris tracker, at CRC in Liege at least.
              %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

          case 'zebris_sfp'
              [sens.fid, sens.pnt, sens.fid_label, sens.label] = read_zebris(filename, 0);
          ...

          This read "read_zebris.m" can probably be replaced by something like

          pos = ft_read_sens(filename , 'fileformat', 'besa_sfp');

          People in Liege at CRC have created apparently "read_zebris.m" and might know more (see comments above).
