        thetext: "at the moment the correcttail option has the default 'no', which means that the prob and mask are incorrect if the user specifies a alpha of 0.05. \n\nThis was just found out based on the eventrelatedstatistics tutorial. I added the option\ncfg.correcttail = 'prob' \nto the eventrelatedstatistics totorial."

          actually, cfg.correcttail = no & cfg.tail = 0 & cfg.alpha = 0.05 (all defaults)
          leads to a warning

        thetext: Didn't we decide to do a year a go to do it like this? Provide a warning for those who were unaware of the issue of the different conventions and corrections, but to let the defaults be as close to how they were for a very long time? As p-values can be a sensitive issue. I thought this was the reason why by default the p-values or the alpha are not corrected, as they never were so in the past.

          additional documentation is now available here:
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/why_should_i_use_the_cfg.correcttail_option_when_using_statistics_montecarlo

          i will leave the default as is (cfg.correcttail = 'no', warning when using this in combination with tail = 0 and alpha = 0.05)
