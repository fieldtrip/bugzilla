          This follows up on a discussion I had with Jan van der Eerden (in person and by mail).

          The implementation has already been finished, this bug is a placeholder for the test script and follow-up discussions

          I cleaned up my bugzilla list by changing the status from resolved (either fixed or wontfix) into closed. If you don't agree, please reopen the bug.

          Hi Bart,

          I suspect that your recent changes to neurosim have caused this older test script now to fail. Can you please have a look?

          See
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dashboard/r7143/test_bug1404
          which reports the error
          unsupported header format (neurosim dir)

          Yes, the recent changes make it important that you specify which file to read the header from. (spikes, evolution or signals)
          In this case it should be spikes.
          However ft_read_header reads some information (e.g. sampling frequency) that was not written in the header on earlier versions of Neurosim.

          So I'll edit the test function and I'll ask Jan to update the examples.

(ft_read_spike vs ft_read_data)\n\nWhat do you want to preprocess here? membrane potentials?, LFPs?\n\nI assume LFP, I can implement something like this (LFPs are in the signals file as 'Extracellular V' for every simulated network)\n\nHowever, the LFP that neurosim calculates is still a little strange, so not very useful at the moment."

          I believe changing the test function is better, because if the user supplies a directory it is unclear what is meant.

          Different files in the neurosim directory have different headers and different sampling rates.

          Besides I believe, right now I am the only one using this (besides Jan and perhaps Eric Lowet). So it will be no problem to switch the input method now.

          for some spike formats (but I don't know whether it applies to all) ft_preprocessing is able to read it and represent it as [00000010000100000101000100...]

          let's discuss following the FT meeting. I believe there are still some design issues with the format that need to be resolved.

          We could implement that by letting ft_read_data perform ft_read_spike and then using ft_checkdata to convert to such a continuous data format.

          I'll be there this afternoon to discuss.
