          I just committed the first steps towards the solution

          manzana> svn commit
          Sending        ft_rejectcomponent.m
          Sending        utilities/ft_datatype_comp.m

          Note that I have added Francesco to the CC, because he initially reported it. I also suggest that he serves as external check to ensure that we fix the problem op the optimal way.
