          This was reported by Yoni at http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=798#c19 and it can be reproduced by the following piece of code (which I'll save to the test directory)

          freq1.label = {'1'};
          freq1.time = [1 2];
          freq1.freq = [1 2 3];
          freq1.dimord = 'chan_freq_time';
          freq1.powspctrm = randn(1,3,2);

          freq2.label = {'1'};
          freq2.time = [1 2];
          freq2.freq = [1 2 3] + 1; % shifted by one
          freq2.dimord = 'chan_freq_time';
          freq2.powspctrm = randn(1,3,2);

          cfg = [];
          cfg.parameter = 'powspctrm';
          ft_appendfreq(cfg, freq1, freq2);


          the input is freq data with 1 channels, 3 frequencybins and 2 timebins

          The error is

          > the input data structures have non-unique frequency bins, concatenation across
          > frequency is not possible

          which is actually consistent with the data: freq1 has [1 2 3], freq2 has [2 3
          4] and these cannot be concatenated.

          Since the problem started in ft_freqstatistics, one might rephrase it as

          cfg = [];
          cfg.parameter = 'powspctrm';
          cfg.appenddim = 'rpt'; % be explicit
          ft_appendfreq(cfg, freq1, freq2);

          failing. The question is whether ft_appendfreq should ensure the overlap of the
          freq axis (i.e. cut of the first sample in freq1 and the last sample in freq2)?
          The old ft_freqstatistics was able to deal with this input, so as such the bug
          remains present, but might not be in ft_appendfreq persee.
