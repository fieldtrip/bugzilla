          I noticed the following in ft_read_surface

            case 'vista'
              ft_hastoolbox('simbio', 1);
              [nodes,elements,labels] = read_vista_mesh(filename);
              shape.nd     = nodes;
              shape.el     = elements;
              shape.labels = labels;
              shape.unit   = unit;

          The fields labels, el and nd are all unknown to me and inconsistent with other head surfaces. Please clarify. Probably we have to sit down together to further standardize the head surface description.

          >     shape.unit   = unit;

          This line will also result in an error, because unit is not defined. Note that I changed the call into ft_hastoolbox.

Note that\n> > I changed the call into ft_hastoolbox.\n> \n> according to the number of elements the .hex or .tet field should be created.\n> Change also .nd into .pnt\n\n.label into 'index' or 'value' ? Index is less general"
