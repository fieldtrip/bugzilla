        thetext: I have searched my computer, my external hard disks and dccn-qnap001, but have not been able to find it. @Stephen or Jorn, have you seen the raw material that was used for the instrumentation youtube video? That should a.o. contain the video from the MPI camera which was shot in the colloquium room.

        thetext: Hi Robert, no, I am sorry, I do not know anything about this. It seems a bit disturbing that the folder on qnap001 is empty, doesn't it? As far as I can remember, it's been empty for a while already and I wondered why. Hope Stephen knows more

I can rsync it from there. Or just attach it to the server through USB, so that you don't have to copy. I can then pull it from USB over the network."
