There are also two example files if you want to try the readers.\n \nAs I mentioned there are also two new export functions which allow to Matlab users to export data in ascii format compatible with BESA: besa_save2Avr.m and besa_save2Swf.m\nThe first one exports the data in ascii vectorized format which is used in BESA for sensor level averaged potentials in time domain and the second one is source wave form file format containing source wave forms in time domain."

        thetext: i cerated the svn account and set it up so that it can read everything, but only write in trunk/external/besa. That should be enough to start with. The user name is "todjor".
