          Test script fails for quite a few cases:

          -ctf64: low level problem reading the header
          -BTI: ft_chanunit returns unknown for gradiometers. According to the low-level header information this is most likely 'T', can be easily fixed
          -itab: in general the chantype does not conform FT-convention, e.g. magnetometers are 'mag' and references are 'ref mag'
          -itab153: the percentage of 'unknown' chanunits is 20.3%, (due to the high number of auxiliairy channels with unknown unit), the test script throws an error at 20%
          -itab28: the percentage of 'unknown' chanunits is 37.5%
          -yokogawa160 fails for reasons I have not yet investigated.

          Suggestion to fix part of the issues: update ft_chanunit (for bti) and ft_chantype (for itab).

          Shall I do that?

          I can look at Yokogawa as I'm now working on that anyway. For the rest I'd be happy if it's fixed.

          For one dataset, the test script started failing:

          OK. I'll check. I looked at those examples and it all worked fine but maybe I missed the 256-channel one. In any case the proper fix should probably be in ft_chantype and ft_chanunits. My PC is being changed today so it might take me till tomorrow to fix it.

          I made a fix and it should be OK now. This was just a dataset with 17 channels that couldn't be properly recognised. Not sure if we should really support it but as long as only Biosemi and ext1020 labels are used on Biosemi systems, it should be OK. I suggest you also add to that test script a Biosemi example with 1020 labels. Here is one:
