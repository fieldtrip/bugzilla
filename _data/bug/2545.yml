          e.g. ft_rejectvisual
          much better than having the user wait for something plotted in the command window, while the user is looking at the figure and wondering why nothing is happening

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable.
