          I have some source data in this format (from 'dics')
          source =
                    dim: [15 18 15]
                   freq: 39.9818264425261
                   time: 0.199999999999991
              cumtapcnt: [515x1 double]
                    pos: [4050x3 double]
                 inside: [1x2015 double]
                outside: [1x2035 double]
                 method: 'average'
                    avg: [1x1 struct]
                    cfg: [1x1 struct]

          If you run
          ft_checkdata(source, 'datatype', 'source')
          (which is run in 'ft_sourcegrandaverage' line 86).

          then it crashes at line 583.
          Error using reshape
          To RESHAPE the number of elements must not change.

          It's because it's trying to reshape the source.pos field. I did not notice the error before because, since yesterday (r5480), parameterselection can handle higher-dimensional data
          http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=5480

          I suggest to add the field 'pos' to the 'exclude' fields (line 560 of ft_checkdata)
            exclude = {'cfg' 'fwhm' 'leadfield' 'q' 'rough'};

          Let me know what you think about it.
          Thanks!

          Hi Giovanni,

          Sorry, my fault. Indeed probably introduced by yesterday's change. I think that adding 'pos' to the exclude is a good idea.
          Could you take care of that?

          Thanks,

          JM

          (In reply to comment #1)
          Ok, I'll do it. Just wanted to be sure that "exclude" is the best solution
