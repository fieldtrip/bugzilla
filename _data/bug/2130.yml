          When calling for instance ft_timelock analysis with a data set larger than 2GB, I get the below error, Commenting out pre and post amble and it runs normally. I suggest some sort of memory check should be done so a function can not error on this, or a try catch or something. I'm using Matlab 2012b on Windows 64 bits PC.

          Error using CalcMD5
          *** CalcMD5[mex]: Input > 2^31 byte not handled yet.

          Error in ft_preamble_provenance (line 53)
            cfg.callinfo.inputhash = cellfun(@CalcMD5, cellfun(@mxSerialize, cellfun(@eval,
            ft_default.preamble, 'UniformOutput', false), 'UniformOutput', false), 'UniformOutput', false);

          Error in ft_preamble (line 54)
            evalin('caller', ['ft_preamble_' cmd]);

          Hi Ingrid,
          Is this the same as bug 1917?

        thetext: "The cause of this bug is indeed what bug 1917 is (sorry missed that one). However, I'd like to urge for a temporary solution in the functions calling it, if fixing bug 1917 is difficult.\n\nI'm not familiar with what it is preample and post amble provenance do exactly, and if it can just be by passed for large files for now. If skipping it is not a big deal (which I think, it's just keeping track of memory/time or something no?), I'd suggest to asap include a check in all functions calling it. If the file is too big, just give a message that time tracking or what ever it does is not possible yet for big files, and by pass preamble. It's very annoying that this bug (1917) now results in an error over something trivial when using large data. \n\nI'll file it as duplicate, and paste this there as well\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 1917 ***"
