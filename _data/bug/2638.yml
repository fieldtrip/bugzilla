          Micro-donations might be a way for getting some funding to the fieldtrip development team.

          These are two that I recently encountered

          https://pledgie.com
          https://flattr.com

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #0)
          Arwen jarig begrijp ik? Gefeliciteerd :)

          About the donation button: I would then also be in favour of adding a Paypal 'Donate' button, my understanding is those buttons typically raise more than Flattr et al.

          Great idea! I had a quick look, and Flattr takes 10% from the donations, whereas Pledgie only takes 3%.   In any case, I think it is fair to be upfront about this to donators, so they know that they are also supporting the donation-page in some part.   (I would therefore vote for Pledgie as they take the smaller percentage).  Or Eelke's suggestin of Paypal directly.

          Do you need to open up a FieldTrip-specific bank account?  Would be nice to keep accounting clean, but annoying that NL accounts charge quarterly fees simply to have an account open!  (UK and US banks don't!)

        thetext: "I think flattr is the largest of its kind and is particularly successful in Europe. I would really appreciate to be able to start a flattr subscription for fieldtrip.\n\nFlattr recently started a cooperation with a payment provider (MangoPay) which (they say) will make it easier to manage your income and to transfer it without further costs to your real-money bank account. \nhttp://blog.flattr.net/2014/05/time-for-change-payments/"
