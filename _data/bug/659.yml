          ...just like cfg.version.matlab etcetera

          we could also add the date and time (and username?) at which the analysis was done

          Nice idea.

          Where are ftFuncTimer and ftFuncClock located? I got an error in ft_conjunctionanalysis not being able to find it. Perhaps this holds true for other functions as well?
