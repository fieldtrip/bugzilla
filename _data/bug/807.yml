          yes it is. But the bug is not in the data persee. It is just that the shape file contains the headshape in coregistered wilimeters and the fiducials are in voxel coordinates. That is inconsistent, and somehow should be dealt with.

          Hi Robert,
          Is this bug related to the data I gave you?   I just realised the 04793_P3T.shape files I gave you don't match the coregistration of this data.
          I didn't see an attachment to the bug.
