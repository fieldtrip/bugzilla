        thetext: "Dear trippers,\n\nI've tried to use FT to convert a neuralynx .ncs file to .edf for development purposes, but ended casing some syntax errors in the FT code, but in the end have not been able to make it run successfully:\n\nfname_ncs       = 'blabla.ncs';\nfname_edf       = 'test.edf';\ndat_ncs         = ft_read_data(fname_ncs);\nhdr_ncs         = ft_read_header(fname_ncs);\n\nhdr_edf         = [];\nhdr_edf.label   = {'chan1'};\nhdr_edf.Fs      = hdr_ncs.Fs;\nft_write_data(fname_edf,dat_ncs(1:hdr_ncs.Fs*10),'chanindx',1,'header',hdr_edf,'dataformat','edf');\n\nhdr2_edf        = ft_read_header(fname_edf);\ndat2_edf        = ft_read_data(fname_edf);\n\nReturns the following error after the last line:\n\n>> dat2_edf        = ft_read_data(fname_edf);\nWarning OPENEDF: Digital Minimum larger than Maximum\nWarning OPENEDF: Failing Physical Maximum\nIndex exceeds matrix dimensions.\n\nError in read_edf (line 178)\n    if EDF.Chan_Select(k)\n\nError in ft_read_header (line 671)\n    hdr = read_edf(filename);\n\nError in ft_read_data (line 185)\n  hdr = ft_read_header(filename, 'headerformat', headerformat, 'checkmaxfilter', checkmaxfilter);\n\nThe error seems to be the result of line 151* in ft_read_data returning empty because tmp is already an number:\n\ntmp = fread(EDF.FILE.FID,[8,EDF.NS],'char')'; %   samples per data record\nEDF.SPR = str2num(char(tmp));      \n\nWhen I remove char/str2num (i.e. EDF.SPR = tmp), the code continues until breaking on line 197 due to a column/row typo: \n\nbi=[0;cumsum(EDF.SPR)];\n\nWhich should be:\n\nbi=[0,cumsum(EDF.SPR)];\n\nAnd then again on 197:\n\nbi=[0;cumsum(EDF.SPR)];\n\nWhich should be:\n\nbi=[0,cumsum(EDF.SPR)];\n\nAt which point it break on line 330/380, at a mexfile called read_16bit, because the offset given is somehow set far too high. \n\nNow, at this point ft_read_data does at least returns a header, which clearly contains a wrong samplerate, namely 1.0323e+06 instead of 32000, as well as the wrong number of .nSamples.\n\nSomething is clearly fishy, but I am lost and fished for bugs as much as I could, and that messy EDF format is not making it easy. Also, after pulling to the latest version some syntax has slightly changed changed at the points I mentioned, which makes we wonder whether a bug crept in more recently.\n\nIt should be easy to replicate the bug: write then try to read some numbers to/from EDF.\n\nBest,\nStephen"

          He Stephen,

          I cannot reproduce your problem. I am not inhibited by any knowledge concerning the particular reading/writing functions, but if I try your approach with some test neuralynx data on /home/common/, I can both write to edf, and read from it.

          I am on the linux cluster, using matlab2016b, using today's version of fieldtrip

          Hi JM,
          Thanks a lot for checking. So strange! I'll get back to it later this week, but it's good to know its me, not FT.
          Best,
          Stephen
