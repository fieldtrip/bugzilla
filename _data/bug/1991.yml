        thetext: This is more a request than a bug. I find it extremely inconvenient to have sourceplot looping infinitely until the the window is closed or one control-c's out. Apart from being inconvenient I consider it pretty ugly code-wise (no hard feelings to who ever wrote it). Using a callback would be much better. However, this would mean that code execution continues immediately which is pretty much against the idea of being backwards compatible. Still, if someone allows me, I would be happy to make the function nicer and make it use a callback.

        thetext: check out private/volumeedit, basically a lot of the callbacks implemented there can be used to replace the stuff in ft_sourceplot. Also consider the same improvement for ft_volumerealign

          I'm going the lazy approach and been moving many things without rewriting much, hope that's alright.

          tomorrow there'll be keyboard shortcuts and I'll fix the broken crosshair. btw, you can now also hold the mouse button and smoothly scroll through the volume, just like in volumeedit.
          got some suggestion for other test data rather than my own? and is it correct that the interactive mode only works for ortho mode? so e.g. no atlas lookup for slice?

          Am I also allowed to protest in favor of this?

          Committed revision 7501.

          I hope I took care of all possibilities and did enough testing.

          Inspired this bug, I created bug 1994 bug 1995 and bug 1996

          Nice! Needed to fix only 1 bug, hehehe. When no functional data in the input I managed to get a crash.
          Now solved with a certain revision.
