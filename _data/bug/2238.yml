        thetext: "I'm reading in and segmenting Netstation data. However, the trials seem shifted in FT. I've attached a picture of the same trial in Netstation and Fieldtrip. The waveforms above the red lines look the same, but in NS they are at the end of the trials, while in FT they are at the beginning of the trial.\nI've checked several things: \n- The timing of the events is the same in NS and FT\n- The raw data are the same\n- FT seems to produce the right trl\n- In NS, the triggers are in the same place in the raw and segmented data, so the error seems to be in FT.\n\nThanks for looking into this!\n\nAnne\n\nPS. I can't get the files uploaded here, so since Diego said he'd look into it, I sent the files directly to him"

          Hi,

          I was wondering if the problem is related to this bug report:
          http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=2151

          Can you check if epochs.xml contains a discontinuity, like:
             <epoch>
                  <beginTime>0</beginTime>
                  <endTime>1351000000</endTime>
                  <firstBlock>1</firstBlock>
                  <lastBlock>1</lastBlock>
              </epoch>
              <epoch>
                  <beginTime>1801000000</beginTime>
                  <endTime>573676000000</endTime>
                  <firstBlock>2</firstBlock>
                  <lastBlock>141</lastBlock>
              </epoch>

          If that's the case, can you check if you have "epochs.xml" (and not
          "epoch.xml") in the dataset? I need to fix this issue ( https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/24 ) but it's been a very busy period for me.

          I don't know if this is related to your problem though.
          HTH,

          g

It seems to be more of a Netstation problem, so the people who created the software are now looking into this.\nThank you very much for your help!\n \nBest,\nAnne"
