          Hi Robert,
          I would like to integrate the spectrum interpolation code into FieldTrip. Would you like to update the code with the new suggested cfg-options (cfg.dftbandwidth etc..) and test it first? Or I could also give it a try and add the new cfg-options myself, if you prefer?

          The new functionality (spectrum interpolation) was integrated into ft_preproc_dftfilter.m with the commits of:  Bug2956 and dftfilter bugfix #272
          Thank you for merging.
