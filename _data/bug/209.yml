          the cfg that is used in volumerealign is not added to the outpuyt structure, probably because so far the mri was kept as tight as possible. However, with the increase in handling volumetric data, it makes sense to also keep the cfg in all processed volumetric data.

          TODO ensure that all processed volumetric data gets a cfg (also with cfg.previous) in the output

          TODO the same might apply to electroderealign/sensorrealign, which has to be checked (if needed, file a seperate bug for this).

          sensorrealign does only take a cfg in the input, so it does not apply

          electroderealign takes an elec into the input, which does not have a cfg
