        thetext: According to the transcriber it became clear we use both 'MATLAB' and 'Matlab' on the wiki. MATLAB itself uses 'MATLAB' instead of 'Matlab'. Can I suggest that someone who knows what he/she's doing will do a grep/replace throughout the code/wiki?

        thetext: Several modifications have been made of changing 'Matlab' into 'MATLAB'. These changes should have covered among others the 'tutorial documentation'.

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable.
