Doesn't that create problems (fieldtrip/private is not in my path, as it should).\n\nBtw, what an enormous path has been added by Fieldtrip! I can't find my own contributions to the path anymore.\n\nBest,\n\nEric"

          Both in private should be fine. might it be that you have another "isfunction" function different than the one that is expected by ft_getuserfun? Coudl you add a breakpoint in ft_getuserfun and type "which isfunction"?


          Regarding private, please see
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/matlab_does_not_see_the_functions_in_the_private_directory

          Regarding the path, please see
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/should_i_add_fieldtrip_with_all_subdirectories_to_my_matlab_path

          which directories are on the path that you had not expected there? The ft_defaults function is used to set the minimum fieldtrip path. All other toolboxes are only added if they are being used (with the ft_hastoolbox helper function).

          With the breakpoint as suggested, Matlab does NOT see isfunction and neither ft_getuserfun (!).

          These are the last lines of my path settings:

          % Fieldtrip directory
          addpath /vol/optdcc/fieldtrip-latest
          ft_defaults

          addpath /vol/optdcc/fieldtrip-latest/qsub

          addpath ~/Matlab/OverruledFieldtripFuncs;


          The last line does not do anything. When I ask for the path, ~/Matlab/OverruledFieldtripFuncs is after the regular Fieldtrip folders. The path must have been set again after the first call to ft_defaults.

          I have attached a file with my horribly long path.

          best,

          Eric

          having 9 different fieldtrip versions on the path, all with addpath(genpath(...)) does not comply with the installation instructions ;-)

          I suggest Roemer takes a look at your path settings.

          I know that I should not use addpath(genpath('path_to_fieldtrip')) and I also did not include it in my path settings.

          Therefore, what makes you think that I did so ...(-;

          Restarted Matlab with exactly the same path settings, the error does not appear anymore and the Fieldtrip path settings are slim again.

If it had been on the mentat cluster, I would have thought that you had done addpath(genpath('/home/common/matlab')).\n\nYou might also have used the graphical \"pathtool\" to set the path and clicked on the \"Add with subfolders\" button, which results in the same as addpath(genpath()).\n\nI suggest you do \n\nrestoredefaultpath\ncd fieldtrip\nft_defaults\n\nand you should be all fine again. You might have to do it every time you start MATLAB though, since your problematic path might be represented on disk (either in pathdef.m or in startup.m) and be executed every time you start.\n\nCan you please tell whether the reported bug persists after you have cleaned up your path?"

          Actually, there was an unexpected interaction with an update script I use to maintain our version here at the DCC cluster and our file server (since a few weeks ago), which in the end caused a nesting of partially deleted versions. This is fixed now.

          However, Eric, it would still have been avoided if you used something like Robert suggested in your startup.m:

          restoredefaultpath
          cd fieldtrip
          ft_defaults

          Or

          restoredefaultpath
          your_own_paths

          Or if you already do this in your startup.m, then restart your matlab a little more often ;)

          Setting bug as fixed.
