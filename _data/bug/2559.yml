        thetext: 'According to ft_datatype_comp, a comp datatype should contain the following fields:  time, trial, label, topo, unmixing. Time-locked component data does not contain a trial field, I therefore propose to update ft_datatype to also check for the presence of a trial field (which it currently does not).'

          ft_checkdata can now handle 'timelock+comp' but ft_databrowser still crashes when plotting timelock+comp data IF cfg.viewmode is 'component' or not specified (if not specified it is set to 'component' automatically as hascomp==1).

          The problem here lies with ft_databrowser detecting the data as containing component information and ft_checkdata removing all the component fields. ft_databrowser then tries to plot data that has been removed.

          Now it depends whether we would like to plot timelock+comp data as comp or raw data, i.e. with or without topographies. In the former case timelock+comp should be converted to comp instead of raw, in the latter case ft_databrowser should not set cfg.viewmode to 'component' if hascomp==1.

          In any case I'm not sure if it is a good idea that ft_databrowser sets the default based on hascomp on the input data as the input data can be changed by ft_checkdata. If used at all, this decision should be based on the output of ft_checkdata.

        thetext: I did some shuffling around in ft_checkdata and related functions a while ago, this seems also to have resolved this bug.
