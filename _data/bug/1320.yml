          spm8 makes use of low-level and high-level fieldtrip functions. Esp. for the high-level functions it would be good to have a test case to ensure that ft changes don't break the spm8 usage.

          (as discussed with Guillaume)

          Hi Robert,

          I've just checked in a script and a mat file with some typical input for testing some aspects of SPM-FT integration. I might add to it in the future. The script fails in one place for MEG concentric spheres. It has something to do with plotting and I couldn't exactly figure it out. Strangely there is no problem in SPM itself. The only difference is that in SPM everything is in CTF coordinates and in the script in MNI coordinates but in both cases in mm so please take a look in case it's something important. Other than that it should work. We upgraded FT in internal SPM8 and hopefully will keep synced from now on.

          Best,

          Vladimir

          Hi Robert,

          I did what I was supposed to do so tell your bugzilla to stop nagging me now.

          Hi Robert,

          The problem with plotting I mentioned does occur in SPM after all and prevents the multiple spheres model from being useful. Could you run my script and fix it?

          Thanks,

          Vladimir

        thetext: "after some changes over the last few days it now runs. \n\n@Vladimir, could you make a separate script for spm8 and for spm12? The spm8 version would remain fixed from now on and should reflect the use of FT functions in the release version of spm8. The spm12 version would still be flexible and would follow the development in the SPM trunk."
