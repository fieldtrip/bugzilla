          On 10 Sep 2014, at 01:23, Timothy Coalson wrote in response to an email from me:

          By the way, in relation to your PS, one thing to make sure to test (since you aim to support cifti-1) is non-square cifti-1 and cifti-2 files that have greater than 1 length in both dimensions.  Cifti-1 puts the dimensions into the NIFTI header backwards, requiring a little hackery to read them (in our case, our nifti reader allows overriding the header dimensions on an already-opened file).

          One way to get such files is to convert the cifti-2 example dtseries to cifti-1 with wb_command.  Then you can read them both and compare the matrices.

          Also, we have never written cifti-1 files with 3 dimensions (and I am probably the only one who has written a 3D cifti in our lab anyway), and the convention I decided on is that the third dimension in cifti-1 goes in the correct place, so only the first two cifti dimensions are swapped in the header in cifti-1.  Of course, you may never need to write cifti-1 anyway.

          ----

          Right now the cifti-1 files are only for simple tests. If I plan to support it (reading only, never writing), I'll have to do the conversion as Tim suggests.

          Hi Robert,
          The new input update in pos2transform private function (now only one input, see )produces errors in some of other functions:

          bash-4.1$ find -type f -name "*.m" -print0 | xargs -0 grep pos2transform | xargs -0 grep pos2transform | grep -v ':%'
          grep: ./plotting/private/ft_datatype_volume.m:    volume.transform = pos2transform(volume.pos, volume.dim);
          ./utilities/private/pos2transform.m:function [transform] = pos2transform(pos)
          ./utilities/private/pos2transform.m:%  [transform] = pos2transform(pos, dim) where pos is an ordered list of positions
          ./utilities/ft_datatype_volume.m:    volume.transform = pos2transform(volume.pos, volume.dim);
          ./utilities/ft_checkdata.m:  data.transform = pos2transform(data.pos, data.dim);
          ./fileio/private/ft_checkdata.m:  data.transform = pos2transform(data.pos, data.dim);
          ./fileio/private/pos2transform.m:function [transform] = pos2transform(pos)
          ./fileio/private/pos2transform.m:%  [transform] = pos2transform(pos, dim) where pos is an ordered list of positions
          ./fileio/ft_write_cifti.m:  source.transform = pos2transform(source.pos);
          ./private/pos2transform.m:function [transform] = pos2transform(pos)
          ./private/pos2transform.m:%  [transform] = pos2transform(pos, dim) where pos is an ordered list of positions

          ./ft_sourceplot.m:    data.transform = pos2transform(data.pos);

          Do you think it's safe to update them from two to one input?
          pos2transform(data.pos, data.dim); -> pos2transform(data.pos);

          (In reply to Diego Lozano Soldevilla from comment #14)

          Hi Diego,

          thanks for notifying me. This seems to be an unwanted side effect due to the (relatively large) merge. There should not have been anything functionally different in pos2transform.

          I will look at it.

          Robert

          Thanks for sorting those problems Robert. I have a couple of other enhancement requests:

          - ft_write_cifti currently does not check whether the filename extension is already present in the filename. If the full name is supplied (e.g. xxx.dtseries.nii), the surface filenames are created correctly, but the extension is appended again on line 158 (resulting in e.g. xxx.dtseries.dtseries.nii). Could be an idea to put a check in for this.

          - Is it possible to add a switch to disable the writing of the surfaces every time? For most of the tasks I need the routines for, writing the surfaces out every time the data changes is not necessary.

          Committed revision 9919.

          I made reading/writing of surface files optional, made debug.xml file optional, changed how the cifti output filename is constructed (parameter is not part of it any more)

          I also changed the checking of the nii file extension and the dtseries/etc extension.
