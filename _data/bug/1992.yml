        thetext: avg152T1 is less blurry while being the same filesize (and probably same subjects averaged over?). The only problem is that it is not (yet) in the FT/external/spm8 directory. Martine pointed me to that after I asked some unanswerable questions about the striatum on the blurred T1.nii.

        thetext: "Please see http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/Templates\n\nYou might want to look up the corresponding help in spm8, see the file \"spm_templates.man\".\n\nThe spm8/templates/T1.nii is used for coregistration and segmentation (together with spm8/tpm/*.nii). \n\nI would not recommend it for visualization of MEG results and visually identifying areas. For that I tend to use the (crisp) single subject T1.\n\nIf you feel like it, you can write a FAQ about this or contribute to http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/template/anatomy and http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/template in general.\n\nOtherwise, feel free to close the issue. I'll assign it to you."

        thetext: changed to won't fix since we go this colin27 template now and it is explicit that the templates are based on a single subject
