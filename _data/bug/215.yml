        thetext: "it also depends on dpss of course.\n\nThe problem arises when peercellfun is used for multiple jobs involving ft_freqanalysis. License limits are easily exceeded when many jobs are run in parallel. \nThis opens the question whether explicit dependency on the signal processing toolbox can be removed by for example for the hanning taper not relying on the window-function, but provide a private hanning_taper function (similar to sine_taper, and alpha_taper).\n\nBy the way, sine_taper and alpha_taper should either become externals to the specest module, or move to specest/private (and externals for these functions should be created in fieldtrip/private, as long as the old implementation of freqanalysis exists)."

        thetext: created the appropriate hanning function, now giving the exact same output is the matlab hanning function. also moved alpha_taper and sine_taper to specest/private, and created the appropriate externals
