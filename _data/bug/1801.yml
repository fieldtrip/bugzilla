          proper use of this will speed up ft_senstype and will prevent it having to go over all the senslabel calls and comparisons.

          it would be comparable to using vol.type

          it would have to be added (to start with) in the xxx2grad functions

        thetext: "This has been implemented in ft_datatyoe_sens and the low level functions. \n\nA problem along the way (solved) was that of undoing the planar balancing, e.g. in order to get sensor positions. The type changes in that case."
