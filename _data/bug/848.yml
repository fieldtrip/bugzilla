          When I click the 'identify' button and subsequently click near a trace, an extra thick black trace appears. This used to (and should) appear on top of the trace that was clicked, along with the label of the channel.

          See the attachment for an illustration. The data only contains the blue and green traces, and the black one appeared suddenly after trying to identify the channel.
