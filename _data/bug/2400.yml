        thetext: "(In reply to Philipp Ruhnau from comment #5)\n\nThe functions in external/stats function should be proper drop-in replacements to reduce the number of stats toolbox licenses that are needed when running it on a compute cluster or in training workshops, not functions with the same name but slightly different functionality. Hence changing the documentation would not address the actual problem. Removing the function does address the core problem, although does increase toolbox license requirements in specific cases.\n\nIt still would be nice to have a drop-in replacement function for randsample, but it should then be implemented from scratch (not looking at the Mathworks code, only at its help) to ensure consistent behavior.  \n\nSee also http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/matlab_requirements?s[]=drop#replacements_for_functions_from_mathworks_toolboxes although I now realize that that documentation is outdated. It would be good to have a set of test scripts for all fieldtrip/external/stats functions (and idem for fieldtrip/external/signal). We do have http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/browse/trunk/test/test_nanstat.m but that tests only a specific subset (which are implemented as mex files)."

          I've written a replacement for randsample.  It performs the functions of the statistics toolbox randsample except for the RandStream option, and weighted resampling, but should satisfy the demands of FT listed above by Robert.  It performs on par with the Mathworks code.  What is the best way to test it, since a number of functions depend upon it?

          function [rnd] = randsample(varargin)

          % Randsample replacement: Craig Richter 2014

              else
                  replace_opt = varargin{3};
              end
          elseif nargin==2

          Well, I found the first bug (in one of the error checks) :-/, here is the updated code:

          end

          n = varargin{1};
          k = varargin{2};

          if ~replace_opt && k>n
              error('population must be larger than selection')
          end

          if replace_opt % sample with replacement
              if length(n)==1
                  rnd = randi(n,k,1); % sample k from 1:n
              elseif length(n)>1
                  rnd = n(randi(length(n),k,1))'; % sample k from population n
              end
