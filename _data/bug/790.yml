          UI update for rejectvisual_summary

          I've overhauled the rejectvisual_summary interface, making the entire thing work through uicontrols. It now functions similarly to the other rejectvisual scripts.

          While it looks like I've changed virtually everything, most of the changes are due to how guidata works; for example, I had to change all instances of `ntrl` to `info.ntrl`. Take a look at the code and let me know what you think. As far as I can tell, it's working without problems.

          There is a known bug with the "show rejected?" button as follows:
          1) reject a channel
          2) turn on "show rejected"
          3) switch metrics
          At this point, the rejected channel will not show up. Simply reject it again (i.e., reject twice) and it will show up as expected.

          I've also beefed up the input handling a little bit (it won't choke if brackets aren't supplied around multiple numbers), but it still could use some more work, as there's no catch if the user supplies too large of a number for either trials or channels.

          Please let me know what you think.

          UI update for rejectvisual_summary

          Changing attachment to a patch.

          One more comment: the whitespace is all messed up, because whenever possible I didn't change it from the previous version, in the hopes that it would make the diff easier to read. I think that's kinda unnecessary now, what with so much being changed, but *shrug*. I can fix that after the fact, if necessary.

The fact that it isn't actually indicated anywhere is just because I forgot to make that clear. I want to keep the amount of static text to a minimum, though... I think we could add a \"help\" button that brings up a window explaining how to use the interface. Although, this particular bit could be moot, because of your next point.\n\n> 2) \n> It may be a personal taste, but I would rather go for buttons and complete\n> mouse-control, rather than inputfields. e.g., add a button for 'reject'.

Assuming we can work around the subplot problem, that's a very good suggestion. I'll start looking into it.\n\nI'm not sure I follow you with the accept button. It sounds similar to the \"view rejected\" button to me.

An intuitive way would be to have two buttons, one for rejecting trials by mouse selection, and one for accepting trials (re-rejecting so to say) by mouse selection. The latter one does of course only make sense if 'view rejected' is on. You could also use the same button for this, and mouse selection is rejecting trials if 'view rejected' is off, and accepting if it is on. \nIf you get the idea, you can maybe make something smart out of this ;)\n\n\n> Heh... that's what happens when I develop the interface using a dual-monitor\n> setup.

          UI update for rejectvisual_summary v3

          I've updated a number of things, and I tried to incorporate the comments. To summarize:

          1) Instead of going for a "reject/accept" button, I just set it up so any activity on either the trials or channel plot will reject/accept trials in the box. Basically, all you need to do is drag now. I think this is the behavior we're looking for... please try it out and let me know.

          1a) I've added a "Rejected channels:" (and separate one for Trials) textarea, which shows which channels/trials have been rejected.

          2) I've added a terminal-style log window at the bottom. You'll note that new text is added at the top of the window (instead of at the bottom) - unless we want to start screwing around with undocumented matlab functions (see http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/setting-line-position-in-edit-box-uicontrol/), this is how we're gonna have to do this.

          3) A bunch of layout changes.

          Note that there is still at least one bug with how "show rejected" works (easily reproducible; (1) run with "viewmode=reject", (2) reject a trial, (3) turn on "show rejected"; it's not shown.) I'm not sure what the problem is.

          Please let me know what you think.

          So, I've realized that the "toggle" feature, which I'm a big fan of, has a pretty fundamental problem in it's current realization. The idea is that channels/trials which aren't selected will still show up, so that the user can easily turn them back on. The problem is that, if there are both channels and trials deselected, there's no way to intelligently place the dots.

          In more detail, consider the fact that deactivating a trial (for example) changes the values in the heatmap plot, and changes the maximum values of the channels. If I deactivate a few bad trials, my channel maximum values have now changed. Now consider that, after I've deactivated a bad trial, I deactivate a channel. I now have changed the values of all my trials, as well. At this point, there's no way to accurately predict what the value should be for *deactivated* trials, since the channel layout was dependent on the selection of trials. It's a catch-22... I can't set trial values without knowing channel values, and I can't update the channel values without knowing trial values. As such, if a trial wasn't used to calculate channel values, subsequent changes to the channel values will yield no meaningful value for deactivated channels.

          This is a problem because we use trial/channel values to do the visual selection. Without a value, points aren't able to be selected using visual selection. The only thing I can think of is to put all deactivated points at a particular place - say, the bottom of the plot - and allow them to be selected there, but that kind of defeats the purpose. Any thoughts?

This is actually the opposite of what you said; it's a problem because the user is able to change both trials and channels, which is kinda the whole point of the summary function. When using the \"toggled\" view, if both channels and trials have been toggled, there's no good way way to plot the \"unselected\" datapoints (i.e., datapoints set to 0 in chansel/trlsel).\n\nIn the interest of getting something done, I think I'll just remove the toggle functionality until I can think of a better way to address it, if one exists.

          UI update for rejectvisual_summary - working code

          OK, this version seems to work. I've removed the "toggle" functionality and made it easier to use the textboxes.

          I also added functionality so that you don't have to type the index number for a given channel, but you can type the label. For example, previously if I wanted to reject channel MEG1133, I would need to type "121" (the index number). I've enabled it to take either text or label, and it will intelligently figure out what you're trying to do. I looked through the various label files to try to ensure it will work for different types of datafiles, but that part definitely needs to be tested on something other than Neuromag data.

          I didn't change the font sizes much, but I moved a few things around; let me know if it still looks ugly.

        thetext: "Hi Elli,\n\nah, I see the problem with toggling... hm, the only way I would see is to have a separate toggle channels and toggle trials button. Would be great, but definitely no must-have.\n\nApart from that, it looks likes your done :) I like especially the toggling channels, i.e. that you can use channel labels or numbers, and that, after rejecting a channel, you see it's label. I removed the # from the label, so that is is more obvious for users that they may use channel labels. I hope that is okay with you!\n\nSome minor things, that I quickly fixed:\nI fixed a bug in the z-value metric - the problem was that you intialize runsum=zeros(info.nchan, info.ntrl), but since you add sum(dat, 2), it needs to be nchanx1. I changed that (line 141). Also, you initialized runss with only the number of selected channel, but dat has the size of all channels. I changed that as well. And, the label for rejected trials said channels instead (line 250).\n\nThe layout looks a bit 'unclean' (e.g. the white background of the metric buttons extends into the instruction label), but I do not consider this as being an issue :) \n\nSince it all works fine for me, I committed your patch and marked this bug as resolved! Thanks for your work! I find the function more easier to use now, and will also use it more often now."

I'm attaching a screenshot of what it looks like on my machine, can you attach a screenshot of the UI on yours?"

          Thanks for the screenshot. I've found the problem and fixed it on my machine. I'll add the patch in a new bug.
