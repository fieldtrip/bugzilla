          it is problematic for BEM (perhaps also FEM) if a dipole is too close to the surface. The inwardshift option might be used for this.

          todo: provide vladimir with code to compute distance, if distance too small, flag points on cortical sheet and (perhaps) move them inward automatically.

          rather than moving a single vertex inward, we might want to make a local deformation field and move a wider section of the sheet inward.

          the solution to this was defined one day later and involves that ft_prepare_sourcemodel should be extended with cortical sheet manipulation options
