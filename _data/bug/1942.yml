          default flank detection: flank from 2 to 3 results in trig value 3

          I'm not sure if this should be implemented, but to me it seems quite handy.

          When I detect events in my MEG data in channel UPPT002 (the response channel), the events will get the value that the channel has just after the flank has occurred. (At least, this is the default behaviour for the CTF system). However, it seems that the UPPT002 values are bitmasks: when buttons 1 and 2 are pressed together, the trigger value assigned is 3. This is annoying, because when people are really fast in paradigms requiring subsequent button presses, trialfuns get tedious to code. It would be easily solvable by assigning the voltage difference after and before the flank to the trigger value.

          To see this, look at the attached screenshots. up.png is using the default 'up' flank detection, updiff.png is using 'updiff', which I implemented. This results in trigger values 2 and 1 for these particular button presses, which is what I would want (instead of 2 and 3).

          I have already implemented (not committed) this, but whether it is actually desired behaviour needs to be discussed.
