        thetext: "I noticed in another matlab toolbox that it is possible to open a webbroswer. Furthermore, the documentation viewer is also quite feature rich. \n\nAt the moment, the reference documentation is only written with \"help ft_functionname\" in mind and limits itself to simple command line situations. We should consider using the more advanced features in the help, e.g. cross-linking and rich content. \n\n--------\n\nfunction dream_gui_help\n\n% dream_gui_help\n%\n% This function is a part of DREAM toolbox available at\n% `http://www.signal.uu.se/Toolbox/dream/'. \n%\n% Copyright (C) 2003-2008 Fredrik Lingvall.\n\nweb(['file:///' which('dreamhelp.html')]);"

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
