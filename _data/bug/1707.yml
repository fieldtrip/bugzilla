          Anecdotally, Stephen reported issues relating to different channels and different orderings of channels that determine the output of ft_timelockstatistics, depending on what the order of the input arguments has been.
          FieldTrip should nowhere assume that the order and list of channels present is the same for all data input arguments, nor that the order is the same in e.g. the data.label and data.grad.label.

        thetext: I think that over the past year, quite some things have been ironed out. For a start, the more or less consistent use of ft_selectdata results in more strict bookkeeping and channel order checking. Since this bug is predating the ft_selectdata era, and because it is rather 'generic' I suggest to close for now, and take up any channel order related issues once they concretely arise.
