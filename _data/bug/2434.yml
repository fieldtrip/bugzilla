          In http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/eventrelatedaveraging at the bottom the following related FAQs are linked:
          {{topic>faq +preprocessing +timelock &list}}

          This results in one FAQ only. Wouldn't it be more wise to link all preprocessing FAQs and all timelock FAQs instead of those which are tagged with preprocessing AND timelock (making this a logical OR rather than a logical AND)?

But I don't know whether you can make \n\nfaq AND preprocessing OR timelock\n\nwork as\n\nfaq AND (preprocessing OR timelock)\n\nor whether that would be parsed as\n\n(faq AND preprocessing) OR timelock"

          From that Wiki:
           Example:

              {{topic>tag1 -tag2}} – Lists all pages tagged with tag1 but not with tag2.
              {{topic>tag1 +tag2}} – Lists all pages tagged with tag1 and tag2.
              {{topic>tag1 tag2}} – Lists all pages tagged with either tag1 or tag2 or both.

          I tested on our wiki: {{topic>tag1 tag2 +tag3}} is ((tag1 OR tag2) AND tag3). So we can use
               {{topic>timelock preprocessing +faq&list}}

          It does *not* work if +faq is put upfront, it needs to be last. +tag apparantly inherently terminates a statement, so tag1 +tag2 tag3 is equivalent to ((tag1 AND tag2)OR tag 3) while +tag tag2 tag3 is (AND tag1 OR tag2 or tag3). Tests with four tags seem to support this, though I did not test in more detail (and because the lists got really long ^^)

          In conclusion: {{topic>tag1 tag2 tag3 ... +faq&list}} can be used.

          Some tutorials did not have a FAQ or example list, changed accordingly on most locations. Some tutorials just do not have FAQs, e.g. TMS+EEG tutorial and the spike tutorials.
          also see bug 2446 which I encountered during my endeavor
