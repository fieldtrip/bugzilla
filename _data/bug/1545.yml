          The official naming scheme according to the 10-20 system and also according to the biosemi webpage is with lower p, see also here:
          http://www.biosemi.com/download/Cap_coords_all.xls

          Remains the question where the capital p comes from - is it some user defined channel name, set by the acquisition system or any other cause? Do you (or does anyone else) know about this?

        thetext: It seems indeed (after consulting with Robert) that it may have to do with a fault in the configuration file of the acquisition system. Indeed it should be Fp1 and Fp2 with a small 'p'.

The \"p\" in here should not be confused with the \"P\" for the parietal electrodes.\n\nIf you wish, you can pick up a copy of the original '58 article at my office (0.88 at the DCCN)."

          So, I guess that this means that for Isabella and for people who have the invalid names in the configuration to their acquisition system, they should either fix it there (if possible), or work with a work around.

          e.g. after reading in the data, do something like

          sel = strmatch('FP1', data.label);
          data.label{sel} = 'Fp1';
          sel = strmatch('FP2', data.label);
          data.label{sel} = 'Fp2';

          (In reply to comment #6)
          Dear Robert and Jan-Mathijs,

          Thanks a lot for you comments.
          I think that for the time being the option that JM proposed is working fine with no problems, so I am happy with this way around.
          Please let me know whether you are implementing a specific function to solve the problem.

          Cheers,
          Isabella
