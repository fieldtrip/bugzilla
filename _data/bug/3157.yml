          I have just added some commits. Not all possible MEG configurations work, but the simplest ones do.

          Please see inspect_bug3157 for an example and simply plug in your own data. To color-code specific channels (over the N20), you would call the function twice, once with e.g. facecolor=white and once with facecolor=red (and facealpha=0.1 in both calls).
