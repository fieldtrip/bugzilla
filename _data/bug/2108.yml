        thetext: Please add a bit more information here. You report only the low level error. It would be very useful if you upload the script, i.e. the code that generates the cfg for the call to ft_sourceinterpolate. Also, please upload some small example data that allows us to reproduce.

          OK. This is better. At present ft_sourceinterpolate does not allow for 4D data (i.e. data defined on a 3D grid + a time dimension) to be interpolated onto a high resolution anatomy. This is partly to protect you against yourself. Note that by doing the interpolation, you will end up with a matrix that has dimensionality:
          256^3 x 287 (287 being your number of time points) I doubt whether you want that.

          added to this, there shouldn't be a principled reason why it should not work.
          I noticed a bug in the code that prevents it to work in the first place.

          Yet, I'd recommend downsampling the anatomy first.

          Hi Nadia,

          I think this is still an issue, but I am not sure. Does it work when you downsample the data, i.e. read in the mri and call ft_volumedownsample on this mri?

          Hi Nadia,

          See my previous comment. Should we still address this?
