          The issue is with timelock data that contains all the trials (so data.trial exists and dimord='rpt_chan_time'), and also has the avg field.

          When I run ft_timelockstatistics with cfg.parameter='avg', the function (correctly) removes the trial field on line 84. However, I believe it should also either modify or completely remove the dimord field because the avg field has the dimord 'chan_time'. Because dimord='rpt_chan_time' still exists, private/prepare_timefreq_data crashes on line 352 because the dimord dimensions do not get set correctly in its subfunction forcedimord (the check on line 475 finds that it still has a dimord field and does not properly set it to be 'chan_time'; this final point is the source of the crash and could be resolved by removing the dimord field earlier in ft_timelockstatistics).

          Don't know how I haven't run into this before, but I guess I never really set keeptrials='yes' in ft_timelockanalysis.

        thetext: After testing, completely removing dimord in ft_timelockstatistics does not seem to be an option, but somehow it needs to be changed to reflect the contents of the avg field (fixdimord?).

        thetext: "Hi Matt,\n\nThanks for posting this. \nThe handling of data structures with numeric data that have different 'dimord's is known to be a bit buggy at the moment. We have the intention to streamline this in the future, but this is not likely to happen anytime soon. In a nutshell, our intention would be to have more than one dimord once a data structure contains numeric fields that have different specifications along their matrix 'axes'. So, for your example this would lead to a timelock structure with both a 'avgdimord' of 'chan_time', and a 'trialdimord' of 'rpt_chan_time'. (for that matter, once there's a covariance as well, it should also have a 'covariancedimord' of 'rpt_chan_chan' (or 'chan_chan') However, this involves a non-trivial change to a lot of code, which potentially breaks the whole toolbox, so we are a bit anxious to get really started.\nWould it be OK for you that for the time being you work around it?\nIndeed, as you already noticed the following should work:\nPrior to calling ft_timelockstatistics, do:\n\ntlck = rmfield(tlck, 'trial');\ntlck.dimord = 'chan_time';"

          Sure, I'm happy to work around it for now in the way that you suggested, though it does seem reasonable to me to do the overwriting of dimord='chan_time' in ft_timelockstatistics, because what else could the dimord possibly be if cfg.parameter='avg'? (To answer my own question, I guess it could be 'chan_chan'). Anyway, I'm looking forward to the multiple dimord feature, good luck with all the changes.

          Now ft_timelockgrandaverage does not support input data with "trial" field. This is the case when ft_timelockanalysis is called with cfg.keeptrials='yes'. The expected behavior from ft_timelockgrandaverage is to compute averages over individuals, not over the single trials and over individuals
