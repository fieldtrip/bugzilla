          the neuromag system has two different types of trigger channels: a number of analogue channels, each representing one ttl-pulse-line and one digital trigger channel, representing the binary combination of these analogue channels. the combination is done within the elekta neuromag software.

          we have been experiencing the problem that if trigger lines were not set at exactly the same time, the flanks might be on different samples in the analogue channels. the digital channel represents this then as two different triggers.

          the attached patch to ft_read_event adds a new version of the reading routine for elekta/neuromag events. it uses the analogue channels to build a new trigger type called "Trigger". the important advantage of the new version is that it has a 'tolerance' option that specifies, how tolerant the building algorithm should be.

          in order to be used, eventformat has to be set to 'neuromag_fif_v2'

          i hope it is usefull.

          well, it's only related in the sense that my patch relies on the correct identification of these chantypes....

          but i am glad that it reappeared on your radar....

          Hi there,

          Thanks for the patch Thomas. I was wondering in what cases you experienced this problem, and using what hardware/software? Although we have not had this problem yet, it would be good to know in what kind of setup this could occur.

          I'm new with this .diff patch. How should I use it?

          Cheers,

          Stephen

          the pull request superseded the old diff in this bug. the issue can be closed.
          best,
