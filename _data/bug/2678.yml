          Hello everyone,
          I just found this site:

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/why_should_i_use_the_cfg.correcttail_option_when_using_statistics_montecarlo

          which is from 2011. I cannot find the option cfg.correcttail in ft_sourcestatistics or ft_freqstatistics so I guess it is obsolete.

          If this is the case it should be mentioned in the above site (and all other parts of the docu) or the site should be deleted altogether.

          All the best,
          Jens

        thetext: it is a specific option for cfg.method=montecarlo, which means that it is implemented in ft_statistics_montecarlo, the actual "work" function that is called by ft_sourcestatistics and ft_freqstatistics etc.

          Oh yes, that makes a lot of sense. Sorry for that.

          However, maybe one should add the line (cfg.correcttail = 'alpha';) in the two source statistics examples at
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/source_statistics

          The statistics there are calculated using cfg.alpha = .05 with cfg.tail = 0 so there is no correction for the two tails done. I can do it, I just don't want to mess around in there without asking.

          Thanks for spotting Jens.

          In order to change the plotting results, I have added a warning/comment to the lines of code. That is: "% note that this only implies single-sided testing"
