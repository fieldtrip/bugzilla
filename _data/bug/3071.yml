        thetext: When Fieldtrip is obtained via git, calls to ft_version (in version e744a4b245f397215b0c16c990a84efe826258b3) create temp files that are not reliably cleaned up on all systems. In my case, repeated indirect (e.g. through ft_selectdata) calls to ft_version create a crippling number of files in /tmp.

          On line 79, ft_version calls tempname, which creates a temporary file. An alternative approach to getting the commit number would be something like
          [status, output]=system('git log --pretty=format:"%H" -1');
          which simply returns the commit number in output, without the need for parsing temporary files.


          Lines 78-101:

          elseif isgit
            tmpfile = tempname;

            olddir = pwd();
            cd(ftpath);
            [status, output] = system(sprintf('git show > %s', tmpfile));
            cd(olddir);
            if status > 0
              % FIXME the command line tools will probably not be available on windows
              error('you seem to have an GIT development copy of FieldTrip, yet ''git show'' does not work as expected');
            end

            fp = fopen(tmpfile);
            if fp>0
              line = fgetl(fp); % the first line contains the commit number
              fclose(fp);
              rev = regexp(line, ' ', 'split');
              rev = rev{2};

              % this is a string like 4d3c309129f12146885120c2853a11362e048ea7
              ftver = rev;
            else
              ftver = 'unknown';
