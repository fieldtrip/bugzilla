          +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #66 +++

          The functions convert_units and estimate_units are missing from forward module




          (I was trying to edit bug 66 (change of severity), but apparently you have to go through the whole cycle, thats' why I duplicated this bug).

          ------

          Dear fieldtrip developers,

          as you may have noticed, in the remaning and moving of the convert_units and estimate_units functions, something got messed up. They used to be file-externals and are now normal functions, but at the same time also the function name changed.

          All changes are correctly represented in the SVN server, but for my own working copy and for the svn working copy that I use for the automatic release version, the two functions in the forward directory could not be updated. In short: your working copy is probably also messed up.

          Please do

          cd ~/matlab/fieldtrip
          rm -rf forward
          svn update --ignore-externals
          cd forward
          svn update

          and everything should work again. By removing the forward folder, followed by the update, a new version is checked out which has the two files correctly in it.

          best regards,
          Robert
