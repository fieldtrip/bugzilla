          according to Rene, and an example he showed me.  For now, this is a placeholder/reminder to question into it further.
          My initial guess is that trials are not meant to be kept depending on the data and bf type that was called (hence not a bug), but perhaps they should/can be kept?

        thetext: this relates a bit to bug 1067, in that there seems to be a difference in naming of configuration options between sensor- and sourcelevel functions. maybe we should rethink some of these names?

        thetext: "Hi Rene,\nAt the moment, ft_sourceanalysis is under major restructuring, but for now the recommended way to keep out trials is this: \nfirst call ft_sourceanalysis with keepfilter='yes' and then call it again with this cfg.grid.filter and also with both cfg.rawtrial='yes' and cfg.keeptrials='yes';   Then you will get out source.trial.\n\nNote the cfg.singletrial is broken and not recommended at the moment.\n\nDocumention in ft_sourceanalysis updated to reflect this.\n\nNew error added to ft_sourceanalysis so it fails if user calls rawtrial='yes' without a grid.filter.\n\nFT dev note: see test_bug1298\nsvn update: 5337"
