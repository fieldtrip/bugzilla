          I wrote this http://mailman.science.ru.nl/pipermail/fieldtrip/2012-August/005531.html on the fieldtrip list, realizing that the script probably won't work any more because it is outdated. It might be not so bad, but nevertheless...

          But given that it is a script that worked in the past, it is actually an interesting test case for inclusion in the test battery. That means that it should be copied into a test script, actually tested, and any backward incompatibilities in FT preferably fixed. If (when needed) fixing of present FT functions does not work, the script on the wiki and test case should be updated.

          See also http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dashboard
          and the actual example page at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/fit_a_dipole_to_the_tactile_erf_after_mechanical_stimulation

          PS in case the script does not work, I also suggest to add Nuria (who posted the question) to the CC of this bug.

        thetext: this is an old bug. I don't think we need the test script any more, at least not now.
