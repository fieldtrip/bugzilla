          anything wrong with adding a workaround to topoplotER (if isfield(data,'topolabel') etc. )?

          Or rather have topoplotIC change the datastructure?

          (the latter sounds better)

        thetext: This was introduced by a recent change in the code involving channel selection. The consequence of this change was that several things were broken. I thought I fixed the issue, but this did not seem to be for all situations. I fixed it now.
