          Given an mri structure with a .anatomy field, ft_volumesegment used to return a structure with the masks (.white, .gray, .csf) *and* .anatomy, where .anatomy was (I assume) simply the same as in the original non-segmented mri. Today I noticed that the .anatomy field is missing from ft_volumesegment output.

          This messses up ft_prepare_sourcemodel:

          Error using ft_volumenormalise (line 109)
          no anatomical information available, this is required for normalisation

          Error in ft_prepare_sourcemodel (line 647)
            normalise        = ft_volumenormalise(tmpcfg,mri);

          (In reply to comment #1)
          That's true.

          But I'm pretty sure that in the past I just put in the segmented volume into both ft_prepare_headmodel and ft_prepare_sourcemodel and got sensible results. (I just checked my previously saved segmented mri structures, and they indeed contained a .anatomy.) But maybe we should just close this one then?

          JM thinks I'm still wrong (me=Eelke).

          check that ft_datatype return segment/volume properly, even if .anatomy is present in segmentation.
