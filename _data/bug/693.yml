          At present, there is a temporary unbalancing performed prior to the actual computations.

          Following the unbalancing, a switchbox is executed based on ft_senstype(sens).

          -Due to the unbalancing the code will never end up in the section: 'XXX_planar'

          -For gradiometer systems, the position of the bottom coil is always taken, not an average of the positions of the coils exceeding a particular threshold.

          Changing and unifying the behaviour of the function (i.e. making it more robust against rank deficient balancing matrix, and using the average position of the coils mainly contributing to a given channel) will affect the default output of the function and thus may affect behavior on function depending on this, i.e. functions such as ft_megplanar and ft_neighbouselection. This should be discussed.
