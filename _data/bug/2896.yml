        thetext: "Related to the dashboard e-mail of May 11th there were a number of functions failing. \n\nAmong others, test_ft_selectdata was failing because ft_selectdata did not correctly extract a requested range of frequencies. I traced the problem to a change made three days ago to increase robustness (irony?) of singleton dimension data in getdimord. Unfortunately there seemed to be a typo in the updated code:\n\nfunction ok = check_trailingdimsunitlength(data, dimtok)\n562\t\n563\tok = false;\n564\tfor k = 1:numel(dimtok)\n565\t  switch dimtok{k}\n566\t    case 'chan'\n>> 567\t      ok = numel(data.label==1);\n568\t    otherwise\n>> 569\t      ok = numel(data.(dimtok{k})==1);\n570\t  end\n571\t  if ok,\n572\t    break;\n573\t  end\n574\tend\n\nIn lines 567 and 569 the numel was not compared to 1 but it basically just returned the numel of the field."
