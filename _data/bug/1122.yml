        thetext: I typically work with 3D grids based on an inverse warp of a specified grid constructed from the MNI template. I have these stored locallly, but it makes sense to provide a set of 3D regular grids in MNI space in the fieldtrip release (for general use.

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

        thetext: This has been discussed with Robert. Of course he wants much more than this, e.g. also different vols for the mni template. I would probably start by making a default singleshell vol (for MEG source reconstruction) along with a few grids at specified resolution.

          revision 5188

          constructed and added a singleshell volume conductor model from standard_mri.mat in fieldtrip/template/headmodel.

          created a directory fieldtrip/template/sourcemodel, containing 3D grids based on standard_mri at the following resolutions: 5mm, 6mm, 8mm, 1cm

          TO DO: update documentation.

          There's a matlab example script that is quite outdated.
