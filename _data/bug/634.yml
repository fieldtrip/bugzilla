          See Perrin et al., 1989, I got an implementation of this.

          The big advantage of using a spherical spline in contrast to the current way of using nearest neighbour interpolation is that local maxima and minima can occur at interpolated sites, whereas nearest neighbouring neglects this possibility and could add an uncontinuity instead.

          Created attachment 253
          matlab script to be implemented

          I asked Rutger from the DCC from whom I got the implementation:
          "
          Thanks for the compliments on the Spherical Spline Interpolation. The implementation (attached) is Jason's. I assume that's what you want to include in FieldTrip? I asked Jason, and he's fine with it being included in FieldTrip. The wrapper around it that made it work with the bad-channel detector was mine, but I think FieldTrip has it's own ways of doing that? Oh, by the way if you want to use it online and speed is a problem, let me know. There a few ways in which it can be improved. I have made a dedicated online version of this combined with the bad channel detector as an "incremental algorithm", just like a filter, where samples or chunks of data can be pushed in and a state is preserved to compute the next iteration. But for offline applications the present version attached is much nicer (easier to understand and operate).
