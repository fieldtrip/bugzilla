          Fixed this in revision 6446:
          - ft_plot_topo throws a warning if nans are present, but does not handle them specifically;
          - ft_topoplotTFR also throws a warning, but does handle them: they are removed before being handed to ft_plot_topo, and the channel markers are also removed.

        thetext: see bug 1977, removing NaNs is made optional to support masking out channels with NaNs. However, when there still are NaNs in the data at the ft_plot_topo level, they will be removed there now. I don't know if this is optimal, since now it's done at two levels. But if we want to support masking of NaN channels (which I'd like), then we have to give ft_plot_topo the NaN channels and deal with them there (to prevent the interpolation problems)
