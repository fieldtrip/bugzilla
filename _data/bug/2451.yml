          Hi Jan, I actually found out that it is not a Matlab bug, because it is there also in a previous function. The bug is simple: One I create a figure and plot anything a bit more complicated than a simple plot, like a spectrum, and I add x or y tick legends, it multiplies them in a crazy way and the whole figure is full of it. I first started to have this problem with eeglab function (pop_topoplot), but now, also with Fieldtrip.
          From this rough description, do you have the widest idea what this could be, or should I provide a sample figure …
          Let me know! Best and thanks for responding to this

        thetext: "Christina e-mailed:\n\nOk, Jan, here is the example.\n \nI load a data array (channels, timepoints, events) and want to plot it using\n \npop_envtopo(EEG, [-200  596] ,'limcontrib',[50 150],'compsplot',[5],'title', 'Largest VEP components','electrodes','off');\n \nand what it does is mess up the tick names, or duplicating them in a weird fashion.\n \nThe same thing happens in fieldtrip, so it is no programme-specific thing and also, not related to my Matlab version (I downgraded it recently …). I noticed it during the Fieldtrip workshop in Stockholm, and Robert suggested to write to bugzilla….\n \nDo you have any clue what to do here?\n \nThanks, Christina\n \nJM's reply:\nI am a bit at a loss what this has to do with FieldTrip. It sounds as if you want to create a composite figure, i.e. consisting of more than 1 set of axes, and then that further refining the figure does not work in the way you expect it to work? is that a correct diagnosis?"

          This is what Christina comments: (@Christina, you can actually comment on the website directly, this takes away the need for me to copy over your replies ;-)).

          Yes. Therefore, it does not have anything to do with Fieldtrip but I thought I had to explain myself why I am writing to this mailing list, I thought up to then you should limit your questions to FT-related questions only …
