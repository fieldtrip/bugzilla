          A maybe related thing that happens, if the GUI buttons are used (by clicking with mouse) the short cut keys (on key board) don't work anymore. (including the 'q'). Mouse still works normally, and closing the figure by clicking on the cross still works as it should. Just annoying.

          works with new implementation

          @Ingrid: I think the problem you describe is more Matlab related. The problem is that the callback function does only work if the handle is the currently selected object. If you click a button, the button's handle becomes the object of interest. I asked Google about this, and he agrees:
          http://www.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/158449

          There seems to be a workaround though by disabling the button, drawnow and enabling it again - and just before sending this comment, I included this in the code and commited the change. ft_databrowser_new ll.723ff

        thetext: to solve the handle issue in ft_databrowser there is the getparent helper function. It will determine the uppermost parent of any figure element handle. Perhaps this can be used to resolve the issue here (which I did not look into in detail)

        thetext: it's solved ;) from what I got from the mathworks forum, the only reliable workaround is by disabling and enabling the button.
