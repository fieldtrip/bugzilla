          Ali reported a problem when ft_prepare_mesh was called with a segmented mri in the input. For some reason the following part of the code did not work. Apparently, cfg.inputfile was not empty, resulting in an empty mri. Consequently basedonseg was not assigned correctly.

          I found the problem. The following is a part of ft_prepare_mesh.m file:

          if ~isempty(cfg.inputfile)
           % the input data should be read from file
           if hasdata
             error('cfg.inputfile should not be used in conjunction with giving
          input data to this function');
           else
             mri = loadvar(cfg.inputfile, 'data');
           end
          else
           mri = [];
          end

          This should be made more robust. Ali suggested: if ~exist('mri', 'var'), mri = []; end
          Yet this should be taken care of by the earlier assigned hasdata.

          I would suggest an explicit conditional check:

          if hasdata && ~isempty(cfg.inputfile)
            error('....');
          elseif hasdata && isempty(cfg.inputfile)
            % this is OK
          elseif ~hasdata && ~isempty(cfg.inputfile)
            mri = loadvar(...);
          elseif ~hasdata && isempty(cfg.inputfile)
            % apparently no input data is needed
            mri = [];
          end

          I made some changes to make the handling of the input more robust.

          Ali, could you do an svn update and report back whether this fixes your issue?

          Thanks.

          Hi Ali,

          This is because svn did not manage merge the changes in the repository (made and committed by me) with the changes you made to your local copy (but did not commit). To be completely sure, you should physically remove your copy (rm ft_prepare_mesh.m) and then update (svn update ft_prepare_mesh.m). In that case, your file will be clean again, and in sync with the svn-repository
