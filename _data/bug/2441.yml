        thetext: the 1mm res and 2mm res anatomical template MRIs (both Colin 27, but downloaded from different locations) have their axes represented inconsistently. One is left-handed, the other right-handed. I suggest to make this consistent (and document this).

        thetext: I guess that the axes (x/y/z) are correct, but that the voxel orientation is inconsistent? I.e. that in one of them there is a -1 or -2 along the diagonal of the mri.transform.

        thetext: That is, both mris seem internally consistent (although I haven't checked whether Colin has a crooked nose). What we could do is just downsample the 1 mm version to 2 mm, and replace the current 2 mm version. Makes them both consistent relative to  one another, and we can still specify the 1 mm resolution image as the source.

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #3)

          I suggest to keep the original 2mm. I suspect it originates from spam. Keeping it (after flipping one axis) makes it easier to explain where it came from.

          the 2 mm comes from the surfrend toolbox (an spm add-on)
          the 1 mm comes from cambridge

        thetext: We could also consider to upload the 152MNI template (as e.g. used in FSL) from http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009

        thetext: I downloaded the colin27 nifti directly from the mcgill's website (see fieldtrip/anatomy/template for link). and replaced the single_subj_T1_1mm with this one. I replaced the single_subj_T1 with a ft_volumedownsampled version, resulting in both anatomicals having right-handed voxel-axes.
