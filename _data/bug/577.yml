        thetext: "I believe there is a bug in ft_channelrepair.m which, in cases when there is no 1:1 mapping between channels and sensors), leads to an incorrect selection of neighbors channels to be included in the repair matrix. In line 107: \n\nrepair(k,l) = 1/distance; \n\nthe neighbor channel is selected using a sensor index. The line should be: \n\nrepair(k, match_str(data.label, sens.label{l})) = 1/distance;\n\nPlease let me know if this is the case.\nThanks"

          Hi,

          Thanks for reporting the bug! Anyway, the bug has already been fixed in early March. If you update your FieldTrip version, the bug is fixed. Just by the way, the fix works exactly how you proposed.

          Best,
          Jörn
