        thetext: "the code for creating data.trialinfo is located within the if-loop for  <if ~isempty(cfg.trl)> when calling ft_redefinetrial(cfg,data). \n\nThe start of this function has a <cfg.trl = ft_getopt(cfg, 'trl', [])>. So, by default cfg.trl = [] \n\nIf the goal is to keep the code as similar as possible prior to change, and that we should reconstruct 'data' (as mentioned in the comment of line 208), then I think we should only change line 213 <trl = cfg.trl>. This line should read <trl = dataold.cfg.trl>;  \n\nIn this way:\n(1) when we get to line 236: if size(cfg.trl,2)>3 will apply, and then subsequent creation of data.trialinfo can take place.\n(2)  the user does not have to explicitly make cfg.trl = data.trl, before calling ft_redefine(cfg,data), which is important because ft_redefinetrial can be used multiple ways, and cfg.trl need not always to be configured prior to calling ft_redefine.\n\nCould someone please check whether this is reasonable?"

          Sat down with JM - learned to go about this in a more logical way.

          Created a test_bug2378 to test if ft_redefinetrial was working. Everything is in order. Closing bug.
