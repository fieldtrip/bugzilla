          I checked the tests with unknown results, below are some findings

          - test_bug1027  may very well take a long time, but also seems to be interactive (i.e. opening a figure and waiting for input)
          - test_bug1093  idem
          - test_bug1223 makes a figure
          - test_bug1227 was a script, not a function (I just fixed it)
          - test_bug168 is interactive, runs forever
          - test_datasets perhaps because it returns a variable? Why would that be a problem?
          - test_historical was not meant for regression testing, is now disabled
          - test_warp don't know

          the first one has been resolved (see comment 7). I suggest that the others are extended with the following lines at the top of the test script

          global ft_default
          ft_default.feedback = 'no'

          This will be automagically mixed into all subsequent cfgs for all fieldtrip function calls, and should make those functions much less verbose.

          Hi Boris,

          A number of test scripts fails in the regression framework due to figures and/or due to asking for user input. For figures in general the regression framework should be robust, e.g. by using xvfb. For interactive input the scripts can of course not be made robust.

          Can you come with a suggestion for dealing with
          1) non-interactive figure-generating test scripts
          2) interactive test scripts?

          # On the point of interactive tests:
          I think we can change the name of interactive test scripts, so that they are not run automatically after each commit. It should be obvious that these are not run automatically:
          - test_* -> run automatically.
          - on of {debug,inspect,notest}_* -> do not run automatically.

          Is that an idea?

          # On figure-generating scripts:
          I'll try to figure (no pun intended) something with a virtual frame-buffer.

        thetext: "We had a discussion yesterday in the FT meeting on the dashboard. I won't repeat the outcome here, but will list a technical idea:\n\nIf you look at\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/shared?do=index\nthere are shared sections. These for example allow the same dataset to be explained in multiple tutorials, \n\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/shared/dataset\nis used in\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/preprocessing\nand referred to at various locations.\n\nThe inclusion of one page in another is done with\n\n{{page>:tutorial:shared:dataset}}\n\nThat is something we can use here as well, i.e. think of dashboard.txt being a plain wiki page and \ndashboard_sorted_rev.txt\ndashboard_sorted_status.txt\ndashboard_sorted_duration.txt\ndashboard_sorted_test.txt\n\nand dashboard.txt would just have headers (to create the page index in the left column) and the pages included.\n\nCreating the sorted txt files is probably very little work on the linux command line (using sort). \n\nIt would mean that Eelke does not have to look into a sortable-table-plugin for the dokuwiki cms. However, that might also be pretty simple, see https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:sortablejs and links on that page, like https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins?plugintag=tables#extension__table\n\nPlease discuss with Eelke what the most efficient way to go forward."

          From a usability standpoint, just having a sortable table is highly preferable to having the same table repeated multiple times, with different sort options. Wouldn't you agree?

          Actually I already looked into this yesterday evening, and my suspicions that it would be quite simple were indeed confirmed. I was not too happy with the sortablejs plugin Robert mentioned, it seems a bit buggy. But I will try to get it working nonetheless; and otherwise just writing my own plugin should be trivial, since there are very good non-dokuwiki javascript-plugins for the functionality (e.g. http://tablesorter.com/docs/).

          Actually the sortablejs plugin works without any trouble whatsoever, apparently the bugs mentioned on its page have all been solved :) See http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/playground for an example.

          Boris, if you make the table like this:

          <sortable 4>
          ^Revision ^ Test ^ Bugzilla ^ Status ^  Duration ^ History ^
          |[[http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=6399|6399]] | test_bug1014 | [[http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=1014|1014]] | [[http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dashboard/r6399/test_bug1014|passed]] |  1.896| ++++++++++|

          ...

          </sortable>

          then it will automatically be sortable, and initially sorted on column 4 (which is status, so 'failed' will be on top).

          the fail testcases fail correctly on my machine and a mentat, but not in the automatic script. probably the reason is that this function is calling ft_multiplotTFR, which can only be used with a display. If no display, no plot, thus nothing can go wrong with plotting (which should)

          some test scripts produce figures which do not result in an error. I know that some low-level figure features can indeed case problems when running in a cron job or on torque without display. Can we confirm the error with a simple test case

          e.g. try the script

          load avgFIC.mat
          cfg = []
          ft_multiplotER(cfg, avgFIC)

          and use matlab_sub to execute it. If there is an error, it should should up in the "e" and "o" files.

          (In reply to comment #31)

          could you not do some awk/perl/python where each 2nd column is encapsulated like this?

          <a http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/browse/trunk/test/test_bug2.m>test_bug2</a>

          Oh, the test files being at different locations under the trunk messes this up. Should we then move them all to one location (fieldtrip/test)?
