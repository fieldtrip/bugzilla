        thetext: "It was only a few minor changes, it worked fine (though that is not a guarantee of course). I made a quick check for the presence of a trl/sampleinfo, and use the one that is available, and some quickies regarding trl-offset (which is not present in sampleinfo). I think it is safe to close it, so I'll go ahead. \nI think they will be rewritten soon though, as Eelke is working on a reworking of the artifact code (I think at least)."
