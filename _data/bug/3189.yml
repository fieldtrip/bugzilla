        thetext: I am working on pre-processing of EEG data using "fieldtrip". I am trying to view the topo-plots of artifacts along with their time courses.As soon as , i run the ft_databrowser(cfg,ic_data) command, matlab is displaying message as "Matlab has encountered an internal problem and it needs to be closed". Please go through the issue and suggest me the changes required. Thanking You.

          can you share a *.mat file containing the cfg and the ic_data structure that you are using in the following code?

          %%
          cfg          = [];
          cfg.channel  = [2:5 15:18]; % components to be plotted
          cfg.viewmode = 'component';
          cfg.layout   = 'biosemi32.lay'; % specify the layout file that should be used for plotting

          ft_databrowser(cfg, ic_data)

        thetext: Hi Siri, have you shared a mat file? If not, we have to assume this as low priority because there is no way for us to follow up. In which case we will close this bug report.
