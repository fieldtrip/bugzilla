        thetext: This is a placeholder of a 'bug' which I would like to investigate further. It seems that ft_sourceplot in the 'ortho' modus is not displaying the right slices in all three subplots. I found this while working on some teaching material for the CNS masters course Neuroimaging II. I am not sure about this, so first will need to create some simulated data to test this further. Now I just post this in order not to forget...

        thetext: 'updated ft_plot_slice: the surface object that is created now has the properties facecolor and facealpha set to texture and texturemap respectively. This for a better match between the mask and the functional data'
