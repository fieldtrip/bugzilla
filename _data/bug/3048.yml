        thetext: "Hello,\n\n(I think this is addressed initially to JM as he made the changes in 2013 that I'm questioning):\n\nOn Nov 7, 2013 I see this change on github:\nhttps://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/322a457727062b33e461ab41eb1e278e94c8ebc4\n\nin particular, the old-line 186 the lines were commented out of actually taking the value from the cfg.randomseed and resetting the seed if/as requested.   The new lines were added near the top (around line 100) to set the value of cfg.randomseed (but nothing is done with that).\n\nThen on Nov 14, 2013 I see this change: \nhttps://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/9162e2e53b48804d6594b5150543fd33ec3475a6 \n(but I don't think this affects things too much).\n\nThen on Oct 2, 2014, the getopt line is removed (fair enough, as cfg.randomseed is now obsolete):\nhttps://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/50238a3f4127d41d37de03d95e2f152e024937bf\n\nMy question is: why was the resetting of the seed and use of cfg.randomseed for this function removed?   It has just caused a problem for me that I ran the same analysis 6 times expecting a difference and didn't get it, but only just realised that it was due to running it on 6 brand-newly-opened Matlab sessions each time (in which case the seed is always reset the same).\n\nShouldn't the seed be randomly reset by default, even if the cfg.randomseed option is removed?   If not, why not?\n\nThank you,\nJohanna"

          Hmmm, those are all valid questions indeed. Of which I don't know the answer :o).
          It could be that your diagnosis is not the whole historical story. I vaguely remember that at some point in time the random seed handling was taken care of by ft_preamble_randomseed. Yet I don't see a trace of this in the current code. Perhaps in previous versions on github.
          In general I'd say that the option should be configureable by the user, and that it should have an effect. It would indeed have most sense to handle this at the level of ft_statistics_montecarlo instead of e.g. at the level of ft_freqstatistics/timelockstatistics

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #1)

          I see that it appears to be used in two high-level functions, but inconsistent:

          mac011> grep randomseed *.m
          ft_componentanalysis.m:%   cfg.randomseed   = integer seed value of user's choice
          ft_componentanalysis.m:%   cfg.randomseed   = comp.cfg.callinfo.randomseed (from previous call)
          ft_componentanalysis.m:ft_preamble randomseed
          ft_componentanalysis.m:ft_postamble randomseed
          ft_statistics_montecarlo.m:%   cfg.randomseed       = string, 'yes', 'no' or a number (default = 'yes')
          ft_statistics_montecarlo.m:%cfg.randomseed   = ft_getopt(cfg, 'randomseed',   'yes');
          ft_statistics_montecarlo.m:% if strcmp(cfg.randomseed, 'no')
          ft_statistics_montecarlo.m:% elseif strcmp(cfg.randomseed, 'yes')
          ft_statistics_montecarlo.m:%   rand('state',cfg.randomseed);

          there is the utilities/private/ft_preamble_randomseed script, and the corresponding ft_postamble_randomseed script, which picks up (at the end) the seed that was used at the beginning.

          I think that ft_statistics_montecarlo should also be calling the pre and postamble and should not be doing it in its own code.

          it seems that ft_componentanalysis already uses ft_preamble randomseed.
          (my local version is not in sync with the repo, but that relates to the dealing with the random number generator in runica. I'll commit this shortly.

          @Robert: do you see a problem in ft_statistics_montecarlo calling pre and postambles?
          Currently, it does not seem to do so.

          I guess the cleanest way would be to include this pre/postamble pair in the relevant high level functions:
          -ft_componentanalysis
          -ft_dipolesimulation
          -ft_connectivitysimulation
          =ft_statistics_montecarlo
          -ft_freqsimulation

          The only thing left to consider (but I don't know whether this would be a problem) is that the preamble is typically called prior to the cfg handling, or does the preamble script also allow for some default settings?

          don't see a problem for statistics_montecarlo doing the p-ambles. You should check however that the low-level cfg options are passed properly in to the high level output with the provenance rollback.

          I am right now working on the three simulation functions and a test script.

          Yes, rollback_provenance is called within the ft_xxxstatistics functions to get the callinfo.randomseed at the right level in the cfg.

          Happy to help!
