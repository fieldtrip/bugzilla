          Ft_freqcomparison uses an output of the ft_freqanalysis as an input.  However, to perform the comparison between two freq structures the ft_freqcomparison only expects the data with dimord: rpt_chan_freq, subj_chan_freq or  chan_freq (it's not stated in the help, but in the code in the 'if'statement).
          If the input argument has dimord represented differently (e.g. chan_freq_time) the comparison is not performed. Not only is this data representation not supported, but also instead of giving an error the function gives a first freq structure (one of two that were supposed to be compared) as an output.

          To reproduce call ft_freqcomparison(cfg,freq1,freq2) with freq1.dimord='chan_freq_time' and freq2='chan_freq_time'.

          Hi Robert,

          Yes, I totally agree, and have once suggested to use ft_math over ft_freqcomparison at the mailing list. Ft_freqcomparison no longer has any use as ft_math can do it all.

          Yours,
          Arjen
