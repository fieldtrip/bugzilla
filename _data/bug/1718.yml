          Hi Arjen,
          I've put the SEF dataset and my structural MRI (I was the subject in the MEG) on home/common/temp /4arjen.
          I'm happy to help further if you want to discuss cfg options, etc.

          if possible, I suggest to rename the data to SubjectSEF or so. Otherwise it might be confusing that it is part of Subject01 etc.

          The MRI seems to be due to intensity inhomogeneity. Correcting for image inhomogeneity is (I think) a standard step in (f)MRI analysis, however, us MEG folks never do it.


          See http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/books/hbf2/pdfs/Ch5.pdf. It has nice equations ;-)

          Thanks, Robert.

          ft_determine_coordsys showed that the mri was incorrectly realigned (left and right dimensions flipped). After correct realignment, the segmented mri looks as attached below.

          Subject05 has been renamed to SubjectSEF, and uploaded to the ftp.

Yes, with appropriate filtering the data is actually quite similar as the figure 4 in the paper. \n\nI had contact with Daniel in Stockholm, and he has granted us the right to reuse their data for our documentation. I think that MN-SEF will be more appropriate for the purpose of the tutorial (which is mainly to look at timing at the source level, for which we would need clear S1 and S2). The NatMEG tutorial dataset consists in total of 4 datasets, all on the same subject.\n\n- one MN-SEF with oddball, quite large stimulus artefact\n- another MN-SEF, no oddball but random ISI, no artefact\n- visual attention task with grating, i.e. gamma\n- auditory oddball\n\nI'll add Stephen to the CC, so that he can follow."

        thetext: "(In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #17)\n\nfrom the HTML documentation at http://natmeg.se/ft_preprocessing/preprocessing.html\n\n-----------\nThe MEG data sets used in this tutorial are two recordings on the same subject during electrical stimulation of the Median Nerve (MN) of the left hand. The reason for the two recordings is that the first recording has a relatively large electrical stimulation artifact, which makes it less suitable for follow-up analysis. The second recording is much cleaner regarding the stimulus artifact, but does not have an experimental manipulation that is of much interest. Hence we will use both.\n\nThe first experiment is an oddball task. A regular train of standard stimuli was presented with an occasional oddball. The oddball consisted of a missing stimulus, i.e. there is no stimulus presented at the expected time. The subject was instructed to count the number missing stimuli. In this experiment the oddball manipulation serves two purposes. First it ensures that the subject maintains a constant level attention to the stimulation; we know that the amplitude of the cortical responses depends on the level of attention. Second, the presence of oddballs allows us to study the brain activity related to the expectation of the stimuli.\n\nIn the second experiment only normal stimuli were presented in a regular sequence with an inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) that was randomized between 1.9 and 2.1 seconds. The subject did not have an explicit task.\n\nIn both cases the MEG signals were recorded with the NatMEG 306 sensor Neuromag Triux system. The Neuromag MEG system has 306 channels located at 102 unique locations in the dewar. Of these, 102 channels are axial magnetometer sensors that measure the magnetic field in the radial direction, i.e. orthogonal to the scalp. The other 2*102 channels are planar gradiometers, which measure the magnetic field gradient tangential to the scalp. The planar gradient MEG data has the advantage that the amplitude typically is the largest directly above a source.\n\n  and then further down there is\n\nfilename1 = 'somsen_run2_raw_tsss.fif';\nfilename2 = 'somstim_raw.fif';\n\n  and also \n\nLet us continue with dataset 1, which consists of standard stimuli and missing stimuli as oddballs.\n\nfilename = filename1;\n\n-----------\n\nI have both files. \n\nand then in http://natmeg.se/ft_timefrequency/timefrequency.html there is another dataset\n\n-----------\n\nWe will work on a dataset of an visual change-detection experiment. Magneto-encephalography (MEG) data was collected using the 306-channel Neuromag Triux MEG system at NatMEG. The subject was instructed to fixate on the screen and press a left- or right-hand button upon a speed change of an inward moving stimulus Each trial started with the presentation of a cue pointing either rightward or leftward, indicating the response hand. Subsequently a fixation cross appeared. After a baseline interval of 1s, an inward moving circular sine-wave grating was presented. After an unpredictable delay, the grating changed speed, after which the subjects had to press a button with the cued hand. In a small fraction of the trials there was no speed change and subjects should not respond.\n\n   and \n\nfilename = 'workshop_visual_sss.fif';\n\n-----------\n\nwhich I also have. From http://natmeg.se/ft_beamformer/beamformer.html I know that I have the MRI corresponding to the workshop_visual_sss.fif dataset. But I don't know whether that is the same subject as the one for the MN stimulation. I think it is not, but I also think that I do know who the other subject was..."

          I came across this 'bug' while working with Lau on https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/1573.

          Reading the (long) history of this bug, it seems that there is no genuine interest of the original stakeholders to take this to a higher level.

          The current version of the tutorial uses SEF data, and is I think OK to serve as a starting point for a tutorial that can be linked to the outside world (currently it is not linked).

          In light of the above PR I have already created a test function out of the code that has been written for the tutorial.

          I will close the bug here, there is no need to keep it open.
