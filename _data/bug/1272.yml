          Hi Irina,

          Thanks for the report!
          Did you add the mask field to the data-structure yourself prior to calling ft_timelockanalysis? In that case, Fieldtrip functions only give back the fields of input structures that are part of the normal output for consistency purposes.

          However, if it's the case that you called ft_timelockanalysis on output of a ft_XXXstatistics function, then I do think the mask field should be retained, and there is a bug in the code.

          Best,
          Roemer

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #2)\nHi Roemer,\n\nHmmm, I am not sure if I understand... The timelockanalysis is called inside the ft_multiplotER function, for some reason that is conditional to my input. I am actually not sure why is it called at all, since my input is already a timelock data. Anyway, after this call, one of the input fields (the mask) is lost, indeed because there are only normal fieldtrip fields in the output. \n\nI  indeed added the mask field to the first dataset manually, prior to calling the ft_multiplotER. \n\n>> avg_c1.mask = mask;\n\nThis is how it should be done according to the ft_multiplotER help, right?\nBut then the maskparameter does not work.\n\nBest,\nIrina"

          Hi Irina,

          Thank you for your quick reply. It sounds like the issue is a little more complicated. You indeed did it in the correct way I think. Could you maybe upload a small mat-file and some code that replicates the problem (e.g. a few trials and a function call)? That would help me in figuring out where it is going wrong.

          Best,
          Roemer

        thetext: "Hi Irina,\n\nBy making a few assumptions I was able to fix the bug without data/code for your specific case (probably). The mask field should now be available to the rest of the plotting code. \n\nThe update should be on our FTP server tonight. Could you check whether it works in your case as well now? Then I can close this bug :).\n\n\nThanks again for the report!\n\nBest,\nRoemer"

          Hi Roemer,

          I am sorry that I didn't reply earlier.
          I checked it now and it works for me!
          Thanks a lot for your work.

          best,
          Irina
