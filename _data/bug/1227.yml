          There is a regression error in test_bug1227

          ------
          Error using spm_write_vol (line 19)
          Can only handle a maximum of 3 dimensions.

          Error in volumewrite_spm (line 75)
                  Va         = spm_write_vol(Va,data);

          Error in ft_write_mri (line 84)
                    V = volumewrite_spm(filename, dat, transform, spmversion);

          Error in ft_sourcewrite (line 59)
            ft_write_mri(cfg.filename, dat, 'dataformat', 'nifti', 'transform', source.transform);

          Error in test_bug1227 (line 34)
          ft_sourcewrite(cfg, source2);
          ------

          At that line in the code of spm_write_vol, the volume is 4D, which spm8 does not like.

        thetext: this bug has been introduced apparently by Vladimir's addition of the 'spm8up' check. Earlier, Freesurfer was used to write nifties, and this worked for 4D volumes.

          Hi Vladimir,

          An error has been introduced in ft_write_mri (line 83) where you implemented the spm8up thingy. It goes wrong when trying to write > 3 dimensional nifti data. Is it OK to remove these lines? The nifties that will be written should be readable by SPM anyway. If the user explicitly wants SPM to write the data, he/she should specify 'nifti_spm' as dataformat. This is handled a few lines up in the code.

          Best,JM

          Hi Jan-Mathijs,

          There is no reason why SPM wouldn't write 4D files. I just wanted to preserve your old code but you could change the switch in volumewrite_spm so that what I put there for 'spm12' would apply to both 'spm8' and 'spm12' cases (current spm8 code can then be removed). This should solve the problem.

          Vladimir
