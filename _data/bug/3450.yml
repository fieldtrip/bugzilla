        thetext: "There was a recent article (and a open source toolbox) published in clinical neurophysiology on methods to detect and remove DBS artifact. \n\nRemoving deep brain stimulation artifacts from the electroencephalogram: Issues, recommendations and an open-source toolbox\nLio, Guillaume et al.\nClinical Neurophysiology , Volume 129 , Issue 10 , 2170 - 2185\n\nIt would be great if this can be implemented in Fieldtrip. Currently, I don't think there is any functionality specifically to address DBS artifact removal. I have attached the paper. They have GUI based matlab code, which I think can be easily incorporated as a preproc function in Fieldtrip.\n\nThanks."

          Feel free to implement support for this functionality or design a pipeline that is based on existing fieldtrip functions.

          If you do the former, please submit as pull request on github.

          If you do the latter, you can add this as an example script on the fieldtrip-wiki.

          I need time to look into this.
          I don't understand your first option. Please clarify
