          When concatenating data over channels using ft_appenddata, an error is returned saying that 'sampleinfo' is missing from the input data. both datasets I put in actually do have the same sampleinfo-fields.

          When looking in the code, it seems that a line like "data.sampleinfo  = varargin{1}.sampleinfo;" is missing around line 254. If I put it in, the code runs fine.

          Hi Stan,

          It probably relates to a change to the code I made yesterday evening. I will fix it.

          The bug was indeed related to a change in revision 9336 related to bug 2518. I have fixed it.

          Note that I also uncommented a section of code related to trial info. This was commented out by Jan-Mathijs in revision 3896, see
          https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/diff?spec=svn3896&r=3896&format=side&path=/trunk/ft_appenddata.m

          it is unclear why it was commented out and the comment "bugfix - #845 sampleinfo should only be initialized if required in output" does not seem to indicate that it should be commented out.
