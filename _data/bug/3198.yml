          as mentioned in https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/issues/60#issuecomment-257796134

          distinguishing between dropped packets and delayed packets is not trivial based on timestamps, especially when you have to make that decision quickly. E.g., if you move your USB mouse while a RF packet arrives at the dongle, that packet will experience some delay along the USB stack to the software.

          if you look at https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/realtime/src/acquisition/openbci/openbci2ft.c#L702 there is a byte with the sample number. I presume that it will roll around every 255 samples, but that still allows packet-drop detection. Perhaps we should start by exposing that sample number as additional channel, i.e. add that as an option in the config file. It would be interesting to see how the unwrapped sample number compares against the timestamp.

          Implemented and merged, see https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/255

          I still need to compile on non-maci64 platforms.
