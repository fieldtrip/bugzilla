          Hi Robert,
          I tried making this trivial change to delete the 2 lines where .offset is created, but the SVN won't let me.  JM informs me that special permissions are needed for modifying code in external/*.   May I have permission for this?  Otherwise, someone with permissions can do it for me, by deleting lines 100 and 117 in eeglab2fieldtrip.m

          The change has to be made in the eeglab SVN repository. Then the files in eeglab have to be synched again, i.e. our copy of the external files has to be updated. Only Arno and me have write access in the external/eeglab directory.

          I suggest you ask Arno to make the change in eeglab, and then I'll update our copy of the eeglab files.
