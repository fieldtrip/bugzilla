Should I use s.th. else?\n\nthank you for your help"

          If I now recompile the code in fieldtrip/realtime/buffer/cpp (which includes OnlineDataManager.h) I don't get an error. Also, If I compile the code in fieldtrip/realtime/acquisition/neurosky there is no error. That code is using the gdf writer.

          Please provide more information on your platform (OS, compiler).


          On another note: Joe Mak (who is working at NeuroSky) provided me with this information

          "ThinkCap is a 7 channel dry-sensor EEG device. It is basically using similar communication protocol with the rest of our other devices. They differ only in the number of channels available and sampling rate (e.g Thinkcap: 7ch/250Hz; Mindset: 1ch/512Hz). I noticed from the code from Stefan Klanke that the sampling rate was set to be 256Hz (line 11, thinkgear2ft.cc: #define FSAMPLE 256.0). I just wonder would I be able to make changes to the source code and recompile the thinkgear2ft.exe?"

          He suggests that (despite the different names that their products get, probably for marketing purposes), that the systems are actually quite alike. Is the Mindwave so different from the ThinkCap that you have to re-implement it, or would a few changes to the existing thinkgear2ft.cc be sufficient?
