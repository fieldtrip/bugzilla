          Hi Eelke,

          this bug sounds similar to bug 2221, but the error message seems to be different.

          anyway, I quickly tried to make this work. however, ft_redefinetrial and ft_selectdata do not extend the time axis. any other function that might do what is needed that comes to your mind? also, I'm gonna bother bug 2227 with this.

          hm, forgot bug 2227, it's more problematic here... so we need to have a common time-axis, which makes us again have all those rounding error problems etc
          ft_selectdata_new can extract all common parameters - maybe add an option there to extend the time-axis and add nans rather than selecting only the common part of the time-axes (around line 510)?

          Discussed at the bugbinge, timelock datasets with different time axes should not be allowed for plotting. I fixed by using /private/checktime throwing an error when mismatch is detected.

          and I updated test function: @Roemer you can see the try/catch error exception here:

          Wait a minute Jorn. I notice that your changed is creating errors in test_tutorial_coherence and test_tutorial_sensor_analysis. The reason is because ft_multiplotER can handle timelock and freq data and freq type of data can have time field or not. Then ft_multiplotER has to check if time field is present in all input datasets and if all time fields are equal.

          Could you please send to me a piece of data on where you encountered the problem? I've to go one revision back and check

          Hi Diego,

          it's just test_bug2160 that failed, so you can test it with data from that test script

          On revision r8536 you assumed that freq data always has time field (lines 226-244) but it's not always the case. Now it's fixed
