          1) is fixed (I'll commit in a second) - the problem was that some plotting variables (hpos and width) were not stored in the figure data. I also had to rearrange some formulas (l. 636ff), they should be alright now.

          2) I am not quite sure what you mean. Do you mean that no event is annotated with a vertical line? There should be quite many vertical lines, actually (for every trigger value, there should be one). Are you loading data from harddisk or using data from memory?

          - I fixed the event problem - the problem was the offset of the data was not taken into account (in code: opt.hlim(1) needed to be added to eventtim). So, Stephen, your problem is resolved now!

           - I fixed another problem which showed the wrong x-values in butterfly viewmode. XTickLabel was only set for "vertical" or "component" viewmode.

           - I will check further, therefore not closing this bug

        thetext: I just tested the new implementation in component viewmode, removed two bugs and checked whether events and artifacts are annotated correctly. I think the function is ready to be made public and can be renamed to ft_databrowser
