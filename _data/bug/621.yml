        thetext: "Hi,\n\nI am creating a brainmask after segmenting the mri, the following way in the MNE pipeline:\n\n% load seg;                               % this was created in the 3. step (segment)\nmask = seg.gray + seg.white + seg.csf; \nspm_smooth(mask,mask,5);\nmask = imfill(mask>0.2, 'holes');\nbrainmask = double(mri_tal.anatomy).*double(mask);\nsave brainmask brainmask;      \n\nThis piece of code doesn't follow the regular FieldTrip style. \n\nI am wondering if the following code would do the same (recently written by Cristiano):\n\ncfg=[];\ncfg.smooth = 5;\ncfg.threshold = 0.5;\nsegment = ft_volumesegment(cfg, mri);\n\nit is supposed to output not only the gray/white/csf segment, but also segment.brainmask.\n\nWould be this the same as the  brainmask above?\n\n(For example, the threshold seems to be different.)\n\nthanks for help\nLilla"

          Hi Jan-Mathijs,

          and should I change the threshold to 0.2 in order to create the same brainmask (as it is now in the MNE pipeline) or should I leave it on 0.5? (in case the "threshold" of the ft_volumesegment refers to the imfill parameter)
          thanks for the help.

          P.S.: Meanwhile I have checked the script, the ft_volumesegment does not seem to use imfil, so those numbers refer to different things. I will just use ft_volumesegment for creating brainmask as it is in the help of the function. Sorry for the unnecessary question,
          Lilla

        thetext: ft_volumesegment has been largely rewritten and now allows to create a brainmask in fieldtrip style
