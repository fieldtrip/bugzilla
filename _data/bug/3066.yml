Ik heb dit als erg handig ondervonden om te kunnen bepalen welke delen van de code niet voldoende worden getest. (Het tegenovergestelde is helaas niet het geval: ook al heeft een functie 100% code coverage, dat betekent nog niet dat de code goed wordt getest). Het is ook handig met PRs in CoSMoMVPA, omdat voor elke PR nu automatisch de test suite en coverage wordt bepaald en gerapporteerd op de PR pagina.\nNu begrijp ik dat FieldTrip nog niet volledig op Octave draait, dus voor testen van FieldTrip lijkt Jenkins - zoals nu wordt gebruikt - ook de beste oplossing voor de toekomst. Echter wellicht dat MOcov handig kan zijn om automatisch coverage reporten te generen voor FieldTrip in HTML, XML of JSON met behulp van de Matlab profiler. Zie bijvoorbeeld de derde use case in MOcov's README bestand [6].\n\n[4] https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit\n[5] https://github.com/MOcov/MOcov\n[6] https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit/blob/master/README.md"

          the matlab function urlread in 2012b supports post, but in a very limited way. I could not get it to work with the dashboard server and reverted to a system call to curl on the command line. The disadvantage is that it won't work on old MATLABs on MS Windows, but it might work on Octave on linux.

          Another feature to implement is filtering on the dependency of external files (i.e. most of them are on our network storage system). Those that need files cannot run everywhere (or more accurate: can run but will fail, whereas many stand-alone scripts are actually interesting to run on a wide range of computers.

          i forgot to add webwrite to the previous commits, it is present now.

          I also added an option to filter for test scripts that load data from files on our network storage. It works by searching for the string "dccnpath". The default is smart, i.e. if central storage is not available, it will exclude the test scripts that will try to read from it.

          There are quite some test scripts that do not use dccnpath correctly and only read from the linux hardcoded /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data (or the windows hardcoded) location. I will update those scripts so that they can also be detected as non-runnable on external computers.

          I tried running this on Octave and came across a few minor errors in the code, which are fixed in this PR: https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/303.

          After these fixes, using Octave (4.0.3) with

              ft_test run upload no loadfile no assertclean no

          did run, although quite a few tests did not pass. I will try and see if it these tests can be run using travis and MOxUnit.

          I have renamed the failing test scripts. I deleted one, which was present twice (test_ft_plot_mesh, also in plotting/test). In the list I renamed, there was one that did not report to the dashboard database correctly (test_old_ft_write_volume) due to messing up the path.
