          E.g. in ft_plot_mesh lines 335-337, there is:

          axis off
          axis vis3d
          axis equal

          and the same in ft_plot_dipole lines 153-155. When using these functions within my own plotting routines, this is undesireable because usually I will want control over these myself. Undoing the effects of these statements is not trivial, unfortunately.

          It seems to me we can safely remove these, or am I missing something?

          (In reply to Eelke Spaak from comment #0)

          if you change it, then please do identify the higher-level fieldtrip functions where these ft_plot_xxx functions are called and make sure that the axis aspects are dealt with in the higher code before removing it.

        thetext: in my opinion the 3D plotting functions that have a geometrical x, y, z along the axes should ensure that the figure is properly spaced for 3D interpretation. Hence the "equal" and "vis3d". The "off" is something I would be fine with if that were to move to the calling function
