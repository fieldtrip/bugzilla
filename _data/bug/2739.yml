        thetext: Functional data seems to be misaligned with respect to the anatomical, such that the functional data is not showing the same point in each of the viewing panels.  See attached figure.  In the attached figure it is also apparent that the grid boundaries don't seem to be matching the cortical surface in all cases, which was specified when the grid was constructed (cfg.inwardshift = 0).

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
