          as discussed with Hanneke (visiting the DCCN today), we should ensure that the existing and planned functionality in FT code to deal with regions of interest works consistently and that it is documented.

          This touches upon a lot of different development threads that we have started (and mostly completed) over the last few years.

Do you know more about the whereabouts of the other MRIs?\n\nIf not, we might have to switch to another dataset."

          The only dataset for which we have a lot and complete data and that we can share freely is

        thetext: "Hallo alle,\n\nI'm almost starting to type in German... \n\nI have put most of the scripts I use in the bug2967 folder on dropbox. Could you please check and give feedback, and maybe think with me about a way and a where to publish this part on the website? I was thinking to start a new example script but I don't know under which chapter this fits best.\n\nWe have now started to analyse our data using this method, but want to make it publically available. My project is running to it's end and I would like to move forward with this.\n \nThe things I added in our workflow at the moment such as plotting will also appear in the dropbox folder shortly.\n\nI have not found the time to make everything fit the test data exaclty, especailly since there is no additional mri, and preprocessed data available, we could also maybe provide a few anonomized datasets of our study?\n\nGroetjes!\n\nHanneke"
