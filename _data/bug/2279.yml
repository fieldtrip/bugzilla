          of course, the 1 layered one does not make too  much sense. Or does it?

          the one-layered one is indeed not meant to represent any true physiological model. It is there just for testing purposes.

        thetext: "I guess the conductivity 1 in the 4 layer mdoel is supposed to be the conductivity of the CSF. When I asked Johannes what kind conductivity they use for CSF in FEM, he wrote: 1.79. Should I change it?\n\nShould I put the default conductivity values into the documentation of ft_headmodel_concentricspheres? \n\n(In reply to comment #2)"

          I guess it is not good to change it because of backwards-compatibilty issues.

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #3)\n\nplease don't make any changes yet. \n\nSee http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Volume_conduction#Knowledge_about_tissue_conductivities which was contributed to Scholarpedia by Carsten and Jan de Munck. Jan has been working on EIT, which is reflected in some self-citations. \n\nthe 1.79 is the value from http://web.mit.edu/people/skkelly/Papers/Baumann_CSF_TBME97.pdf\n\nhowever http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/54/16/002/pdf/pmb9_16_002.pdf reports other values\n\nthe [0.3300 1 0.0042 0.3300] sequence is normalized to CSF conductivity. I don't recall what the reference for these values is, but it was in use in BESA a long time ago (and perhaps still).\n\nI consider it a sensitive decision. \n\nPerhaps you could start with a FAQ: What is the electrical conductivity of the human head?"
