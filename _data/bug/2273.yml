        thetext: In the databrowser artifacts are shown as a range that is coloured.  Some artifacts, such as a jump artifact have start and end points that are the same.  It would be helpful that this is detected and a line is plotted instead of a patch.  Right now, nothing is plotted and leads the user to believe an error has been made.

        thetext: Hi Craig, thanks for the report. Artifacts are now plotted from half a sample before to half a sample after their begsample and endsample, making sure single sample artifacts are visible. One has to use a big figure window though, otherwise they are still not visible (due to matlab's way of plotting lines).
