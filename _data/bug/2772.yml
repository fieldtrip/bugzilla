          when i run ft_sourceplot in ortho mode under matlab 2014b, the color limits were only set for the bottom left view. i digged into it and found that this might have something to do with matlab's new graphics system. the caxis function, setting the color limits in line 1464 only applies to the last plotted image.

          i resolved this by fixing another bug: ft_plot_ortho does not accept 'colorlim' keywords. instead, they are called 'clim'.

          i created a pull request on git.

          https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/51

          i do not know if this solves the problem completely, but it works for me....

          best,
          thomas

        thetext: "Hi Thomas, it seems the issue is still there for me. \n\nIt appears that the limits are now set correctly but the functional data disappears as soon as the cursors are drawn, this happens starting on line 1501 \n\nif opt.crosshair\n  if opt.init\n    hch1 = crosshair([xi 1 zi], 'parent', opt.handlesaxes(1));\n    hch3 = crosshair([xi yi opt.dim(3)], 'parent', opt.handlesaxes(3));\n    hch2 = crosshair([opt.dim(1) yi zi], 'parent', opt.handlesaxes(2));\n    opt.handlescross  = [hch1(:)';hch2(:)';hch3(:)'];\n  else\n    crosshair([xi 1 zi], 'handle', opt.handlescross(1, :));\n    crosshair([opt.dim(1) yi zi], 'handle', opt.handlescross(2, :));\n    crosshair([xi yi opt.dim(3)], 'handle', opt.handlescross(3, :));\n  end\nend\n\nI recall that the ordering of layers in images changed in 2014b as well, so I'm guessing it has something to do with linking the crosshairs to axis and this causing the functional data to disappear behind the anatomical data."

          hi jim,
          i cannot replicate your problem with matlab 2014b on windows.
          furthermore, it seems to be like this might be a new bug. so i think the best strategy would be to open a new bug report for it.
          best,
          thomas
