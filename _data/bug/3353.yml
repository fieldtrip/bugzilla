          I came across this too last week (didn't know there was already a bug filed about it).

          The first issue has been fixed by now.

          I'll look into the second one.

          OK, confirmed. I converted Lau's code into a test function.

          The numerical difference in the positions is on the order of 10^-13 (taking the sqrt, as compared to Lau's reported numbers)

          I propose to be a bit more lenient in the comparison of the source positions with the parcellation positions by replacing isequaln with isalmostequal.

          This requires isalmostequal to be present in fieldtrip/private (rather than only in fieldtrip/test/private), and thus an addition to synchronize-private.sh as well.
