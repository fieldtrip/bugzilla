          See title; both the website and bugzilla have recently (over the past few weeks) been very slow to respond. A single request might have a latency of up to 10 seconds, and occasionally will not be fulfilled at all. I know that several people here in Oxford are experiencing the same thing (and it is not a general issue with internet connectivity here).

          Is there something up with the webserver? Or is everything running fine in Nijmegen and might it be due to the uplink of the network there to either the rest of the world or Britain specifically?

          It would be great if this were fixed before the FT workshop in London in a few weeks.

          @Rene and Ed, are you aware of bottlenecks in the web or bugzilla VMs or the corresponding ESX host? Or might there be a networking problem out of the university?

          I have not noticed anything myself.

          Hi Robert and Eelke, we do not see any strange performance issues on the webserver. CPU below 25%, memory below 40 % and netwerk below 5 Mbps.

          Rene.

          Hi Eelke,

          no, I had absolutely no issue so far, but I am also hardly browsing the ft page currently. I CCed myself as a reminder to check the webpage every once in a while to monitor whether I experience something like this.

Don't worry, I wasn't frantically checking the website at those hours, but I have an "uptime robot" which checks the website every 5 mins and sends me an email if it's down. (I activated this a few weeks ago when I filed this bug; this is the first time it's alerted me.)
