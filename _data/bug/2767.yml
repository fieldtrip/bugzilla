        thetext: "Woojin Choi (CC) approached me by email regarding a fif file that has been processed (in this case averaged over trials) by Elekta software, asking whether it is possible to process this data further in FieldTrip. \n\nThat should be possible, but I realise that \n1) the file causes problem when reading\n2) we don't have documentation about reading processed data. \n\nRe 2: we do this a lot for BESA, but usually not for other systems, although it should also work for neuroscan *.avg etcetera."

          I made a test script which in principle should just work (but does not).

          I fixed the path to the test file in the test script. No progress on the issue itself,

        thetext: "I had a close look at the fif file. The problem arises in fieldtrip/external/mne/fiff_read_evoked_all.m around line 200, where \n\n  if aspect_kind == FIFF.FIFFV_ASPECT_AVERAGE\n\ndoes not hold. Subsequently the variable \"data\" does not get assigned. This is actually caught in ft_read_header, causing hdr.nSamples to become zero. So the fieldtrip representation of the evoked data (having 0 samples) is correct.\n\nI made the warning and error reporting a bit more informative. But there is nothing in the code I can fix to resolve it. I suggest you look into teh averaging procedure once more.\n\nNote that the external/mne code is not maintained by us, so if you believe that to be incorrect, you have to contact the MNE developers.\n\nbest regards,\nRobert\n\n\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit\nSending        fileio/ft_read_data.m\nSending        fileio/ft_read_header.m\nSending        test/test_bug2767.m\nTransmitting file data ...\nCommitted revision 10120."
