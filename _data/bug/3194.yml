          prepare_mesh_hexahedral uses .pnt instead of .pos

          I recalled a bug where the switch from .pnt to .pos was discussed, but I couldn't find it through the search.

          Thus far we somehow dealt with it with fixpos. Does this still apply?

        thetext: fixpos is only meant to fix the input that the functions get, as that might be coming from a user script or an old file stored on disk. The code itself should not use put any more.

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #1)
          Ok, sounds reasonable. I change .pnt to .pos in the code then.

        thetext: "With \nmac011> grep -l put fieldtrip/*.m\nand\nmac011> grep -l put fieldtrip/private/*.m\nI see that there are still many more functions that use pnt. If we slowly change the code (testing it every time), then perhaps in a year form now we'll have pos throughout.\n\nPlease go ahead and send a PR."
