        thetext: It is a bit strange, because either ft_chantype(hdr) can detect headcoils when reading data on disc or this bug has been fixed. I am 100% sure that it broke in the MEG scanner when using the buffer.

          I hereby confirm again that it breaks in the lab while using the buffer.

          In my personal headlocalizer script (which is Arjen's script + the possibility to make a one frame snapshot only rather than a continuous loop) I solved it this way:

          [~, chanindx] = match_str('headloc', hdr.orig.chantype);

        thetext: The ft_realtime_headlocalization function has been running in the DCCN MEG lab for quite some time. So I guess this bug is not pertinent any more.
