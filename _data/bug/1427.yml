          This is requested as solution for EEGLAB, which expects the user to click on a filename in the GUI.

          Solution:  ft_read_header and ft_read_data both call dataset2files. If dataset2files knows how to deal with either the *.mff directory name or with the files inside that directory, it can return the correctly specified mff directory name.

          dataset2files relies on ft_filetype to detect the file. So step 1 is to make that function smarter and detect most (or all) of the possible files in the  mff package.

          I have started with a test script (test_bug1427) that goes over the desired implementation steps.

        thetext: "I have updated the test script to use another mff dataset, as the one initially used contains multiple epochs. These epochs were initially not visible, but recent improvements to the egi_mff_v1 implementation made them visible (and explicitly unsupported). \n\nWith another (more sane) mff dataset the test script runs fine, and ft_read_data/header can be used on any file in the mff directory. \n\nI take it that EEGLAB will also just work with it."
