          - there is no check that the "chan" dimension contains the correct number of channels for multiple comparisons (in other words that it is the same size as the neighbouring matrix). I have run several simulations where Fieldtrip detected that (I had my channels defined in the "freq" dimension and Fieldtrip performed the cluster correction there - which is strange because for freqs, Fieldtrip should perform a classical correction not based on channel neighbours - maybe it did?). Anyway, it would be good if cluster correction for channels could only be done in the channel dimension and if there was a check that the neighbouring matrix has the same size as the chan dimension. I can investigate more to try to get you a reproducible example if you want.

          I did more tests and it did generate an error

          ??? Error using ==> findcluster at 59
          invalid dimension of spatdimneighbstructmat

          I must have been confused.
