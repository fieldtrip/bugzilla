          This goes for the whole team.

          first step: try to find good literature about it.
          second step: read it.
          third step: explain it to one another.
          fourth step: apply it in small 'projects'.
          fifth step: the real deal.

          I have never had this problem. I don't think it depends on the repository. It seems a problem with the configuration of the remote.

          Can you push any file at all? Maybe try:
          git remote -v

          In my case, it looks like this:
          origin	git@github.com:gpiantoni/fieldtrip.git (fetch)
          origin	git@github.com:gpiantoni/fieldtrip.git (push)

          I ran into this problem http://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2010/08/27/git-svn-info-unable-to-determine-upstream-svn-information-from-working-tree-history

          After doing it once more and now taking very good care of not doing anything with the git-svn exemplar on my local computer, I now have a git-svn repo on my local computer and on github that allows me to do

          mac001> git svn rebase
          mac001> git push origin master

          resulting in the latest svn changes being sent to github. So https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commits/master looks ok, including the svn updates from today.

          I will do
          tar cvzf fieldtrip-git-svn-r7407.tgz fieldtrip-git-svn/
          to secure this specific copy, as appears that is the only one that allows me to keep them synched. I'll also try to make an svn hook (or cron job) to do this automatically to keep all (public) versions always in  sync.

          On a related note: the page http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows is important. We are used with SVN to use the "Centralized-Workflow". With regards to git we should move to the "Integration-Manager-Workflow".

        thetext: A question on our linking of svn and git. I just pushed a commit in git that affected the same file (ft_findcfg) in two different locations (utilities and utilities/private). I edited both copies because it was recursively calling itself in both locations, and committed them at the same time. Hopefully, this doesn't put svn in an eternal syncing loop, i.e. seeing file1 changed and changing file2 as well, than changing file1 again because file2 changed ad nauseum. I don't expect it to, but thought to ask just in case. Doing it here, so the rest of the team is aware of it too.

Yet it ended up in the SVN repository... \nThe git-clone that you use to get all changes automatically from git into SVN, is that one separate from the one you use to handle git-merges? If not, it might be the case that temporary git-code (like the above) accidentally get's put into the SVN repository, which then get's fed back into git after you resolved the conflicts (and thus removed the temp code). \n\nIf so, maybe it's better to have a separate git-clone for the svn-merging (one that only get's updated after all merge conflicts have been resolved).
