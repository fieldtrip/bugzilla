        thetext: "I'm using fieldtrip20110131.\n\nI tried switching to fieldtrip's 129 channel EGI GSN electrode template file (fieldtrip-20110131/template/GSN-HydroCel-129.sfp), but found an issue with rotation of multi and topo plots because fieldtrip wasn't recognizing the sensor type correctly (to have the nose plotted up, cfg.rotation should be 0, not 90 as ft_prepare_layout does with the 'electrode' case on line 706). Important: note that the electrode labels in all of the GSN files have capitalized \"E\"s before the actual electrode numbers.\n\nHere's what seems to be the problem: \n\nIn ft_senstype (e.g., line 251), these labels (with capital \"E\"s) are compared to the output of ft_senslabel (cases for EGI electrodes are lines 2737-2759), which gives lowercase \"e\"s, and thus there is no match with ismember (in ft_senstype, line 251).\n\nHere's a solution:\n\nEither ft_senslabel needs to sprintf capital instead of lowercase \"E\"s (lines 2737-2759), or all of the GSN template files need to have lowercase instead of capital \"E\"s.\n\nLet me know if you don't think this is a problem, but there's clearly no way to match between the GSN file labels and the output of ft_senslabel since ismember (in ft_senstype, line 251) is case sensitive.\n\nAdditionally, I don't think you control the electrode files and instead they come from EGI or BESA or something, but with the 3 fiduciary points in the GSN files (FidNz, FidT9, FidT10; which are just markers for the nasion and pre-auricular points), the plots in ft_multiplotTFR are not rendered correctly (they are tiny, too small to be seen). I guess it makes sense now why I've been using my own electrode template with lowercase Es and fiduciary points removed... :) back to my own file until this is fixed.\n\nMatt"

          Hi Matt,

          Thanks for reporting and already pointing to a solution. We will fix it a.s.a.p

          Hi Matt,

          I changed the 'e' in ft_senslabel into 'E'. Hopefully, this already solves something.

          I don't really understand what's going on with the scaling, when the fiducials are taken into account. Need to check this.

          BW, JM

          Hi Matt,

          I updated ft_prepare_layout leading to an improved size of the TFR boxes (basically forcing it not to look at the locations of the fiducial 'electrodes'). Will you let me know whether this change is sufficient for you in order to swap back to using the .sfp files from FieldTrip, rather than your own layout?

          Thanks,
          Jan-Mathijs

          Hi Jan-Mathijs,

          I've verified that your change to how ft_prepare_layout deals with the 'Fid' electrodes now plots reasonably sized TFR (and ERP) boxes in ft_multiplotTFR (and ft_multiplotER). Now I'll use the FT .sfp electrode files.

          Thanks!
          Matt
