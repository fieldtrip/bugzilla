        thetext: "Hm. At the moment (of the current code that is), it does seem that .avg should be required.  \n\nHowever, if I ever get around to finalizing bug 656 of making it possible that ft_timelockanalysis can compute only a .cov and not an .avg, then .avg should not be required, but rather either a .avg or a .cov required.\n\nCertainly the typo in the comments should be changed for the _FREQ thing!"

        thetext: it can also contain timelock.trial as 3-D array, which has dimord=rpt_chan_time. However, I would indeed expect either avg or trial (not as cell-array as in raw data, but as 3-D array) to be present.

        thetext: Updated the _FREQ bit, and also allowed 'avg' as an optional (not required) field, in the comments section.  Updated via pull-request on Github
