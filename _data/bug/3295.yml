          Created attachment 839
          demo script for the bug

          hi,
          the previous behavior of ft_appenddata was that if you would append two or more data structures over the rpt dimension and these data structures have different channels, only those channels present in all the data structures and their data would end up in the result.

          this behavior has changed dramatically leading to inconsistent data structures.

          in the attached script, i simulate some data with 10 channels. i then create a version of that data with 7 and 6 channels, both taken out of the original data structure. the two new structures only share 3 of their channels.

          in the next step, ft_appenddata is used to combine the three data structures. i would expect the result to have all trials containing only the info of those 3 channels, common to all the structures. but instead, the label field of the result contains all 10 original channels while the 150 trials contain the full set of channels present in the data structure they originate from.

          best,
          thomas

          Hi Thomas,

          Which version of ft are you using? When I used the latest:

          K>> size(data_few_1.trial{1})

          ans =

               7   200

          K>> size(data_few_1.label)

          ans =

               7     1

          and

          K>> size(data_few_2.trial{1})

          ans =

               6   200

          K>> size(data_few_2.label)

          ans =

               6     1

        thetext: "Hi Thomas,\n\nI was able to replicate the issue. It seems append_common is doing its work properly, finding the 3 channels that overlap across your 3 datasets:\n\nline 123 in ft_appenddata: \ndata = append_common(cfg, dummy{:});\n\ndata = \n\n    label: {3x1 cell}\n\ndata.label\n\nans = \n\n    'chan_04'\n    'chan_05'\n    'chan_06'\n\nHowever, at lines 155 to 169, this information is not taken into account. As a result, data_final has 10 channel labels but unequally-sized trial matrices depending on the appended data (e.g. 10 rows, 7 rows, and 6 rows).\n\nI'm cc'ing Robert, to see where he thinks the fix should be implemented. That is, either in ft_appenddata or in append_common, in case the issue replicates with timelock and freq data."

          I thought that it only pertained to the default behavior of the function, but actually this is a blatant bug in ft_appenddata.

          with
          ft_appenddata(cfg, data_all, data_few_1, data_few_2);
          it returns a data structure that is internally not consistent.
