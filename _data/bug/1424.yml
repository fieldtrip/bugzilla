          whoopa, my bad! It is related to bug 1335, there I wrote this:

          "default is 'global' scaling using 'maxmin'
          The previous default was some kind of mix between maxmin and maxabs: Every
          topography was scaled by it's own absolute maximum, but by MATLAB default the
          color scheme was adjusted according to the global minimum and maximum"

          btw, Johanna, you and Eelke voted for 'global' in bug 1335 - my intention back then was to make 'local' the default ;)

        thetext: I was just looking at a component structure in which the first 2 components had much greater power than the rest, thus the only way to see the spatial structure of the remaining components was to use 'local', hence my vote here for 'local'.

          Same for me, that's why I implemented the option :)

          keep the default global and update the documentation.

        thetext: '''global'' kept as default, so user is aware of global differences between topos.  they can easily set to ''local'' if they prefer it for viewing purposes. documentation updated, svn r5781.'
