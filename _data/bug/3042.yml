        thetext: here at the workshop in Marseille we encountered an interesting use case of first brainstorm, followed by a FT analysis. For that it would be nice to continue in FT on the same (cortical) source model.

          Note that many of the fields in the surfaces are not present immediately after importing the anatomy of the subject.

          - VertConn, VertNormals, Curvature, SulciMap: Computed the first time the surface is loaded for display (see brainstorm3/toolbox/io/in_tess_bst.m)
          - Reg: contains the registered spheres from FreeSurfer, or squares from BrainSUite.
          - tess2mri_interp: Interpolation matrix between the surface and the MRI, computed only when needed.
          - mrimask: Volume mask corresponding to this surface, computed only when needed.
          - Atlas: ROIs, user-defined parcellations or FreeSurfer/BrainSuite atlases.

          Do you need help with anything?

          I don't know about the brainstorm specifics, but do the brainstorm source models also come without an atlas? in that case we might want to consider also building in functionality in ft_read_headshape.

          When reading in freesurfer files, or hcp .gii files things like
          .curv and
          .sulc are added to the mesh. These map directly onto Curvature and SulciMap respectively.

          The atlases are only saved in the surface files. The information is not copied to the source models: when reading a head model, you also need to read the surface file pointed by the .SurfaceFile field.

          Curvature, SulciMap: Computed from Brainstorm.

          The files read from the FreeSurfer segmentation folders are listed here:

        thetext: Oh, I should not have closed. I think it would be good to follow up with a more complete example. The only one I have now is based on a single file from Valerie (CC).
