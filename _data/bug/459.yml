        thetext: "at the end of the \"handling continuous data\" tutorial at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/continuous it says\n\n % or alternatively use the already rereferenced EEG data and segment it into 1-second pieces\n data_ref                 = ft_preprocessing(cfg, data_all);\n\nwhich suggests that ft_preprocessing can segment the data. Actually I don't know whether that is the case. Normally I would have use ft_redefinetrial for this. \n\nIt should be checked whether this use of the code is correct. \n\nRegardless of whether it is correct, I suggest to replace the re-segmenting by ft_redefinetrial ( because it is simpler, does not require a trialfun/definetrial and more consistent with other uses)."

        thetext: it indeed did not work. I changed it into redefinetrial.
