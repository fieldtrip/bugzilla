        thetext: The idea would be that Roemer facilitates Craig to improve the databrowser. Craig apparently has some very cool ideas, and he has svn permissions, so in principle he could do the commits himself. Roemer will help him to develop a suite of tests that need to pass before committing. This likely entails different types of data (both as raw data files, and as FT-processed data structures, channel/component data, epoched/continuous), on which the databrowser should still be working as expected. I.e. not only working on Craig's data ;-).

        thetext: "From my email:\n******\nHi Craig,\n\nSorry for the long delay. We talked today about a good platform for working together with (part of) the rest of the team. We can use bugzilla for this, and communicate via different 'bugs'. The idea is to use a ft_databrowser mother-bug for general discussion, and importantly, use specific bugs for working on specific features. The important thing here is to add the mother-bug as a 'dependency' (there's a field for this during bug creation). Then, whenever one of these specific sub-bugs is updated, an email will automatically be send to the people CC'ed on the mother-bug. \n\nSeparating specific features and general discussion will help keeping things tidy, and hopefully aid in the development process.\n\nI've made the mother-bug here:\nhttp://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=2314\nWe can use this bug for general discussion on how to proceed with adding functionality to the databrowser, how to test it with several test-datasets (that we have here in Nijmegen for automatic testing), etc.\n\nI've also made an example bug which has the mother-bug as a dependency:\nhttp://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=2315\nThis bug is about the multicolumn layouts you suggested, and assigned to you.\n\nPlease feel free to create additional bugs for additional ideas (and link them to the mother-bug). You can always add me as a CC directly. \n\nI also added this comment to the bug intended for getting the collaboration started, improving it, etc. \n\nAll the best,\nRoemer\n*****"

          To do:
          1) Provide Craig with several test-datasets we use for automatic testing.
          The scenarios that should be tested should include:
          - several MEG systems
          - several EEG systems
          - raw-data in ft_databrowser(cfg,data) syntax
          - raw-data in ft_databrowser(cfg) syntax (data will read-in during plotting)
          - output from ft_componentanalysis, i.e. ft_databrowser(cfg,comp)
          - plotting with viewmode = 'vertical' and viewmode = 'butterfly'

          I think that the teaming up has taken place. Meanwhile, Roemer has moved on, and it seems that there is little incentive at the moment to further improve the databrowser.
          Hence, I will close this one for now.
