        thetext: When using ft_sourceplot for my beamformer results, I'm getting an error in line 888 of ft_read_headshape ("unknown" file format is unknown). The function from FT version 2013/12/31 plots the results without any errors, but the current mentat version gives the error (last change to ft_read_headshape is from February 27th).

          Hi Vitoria

          see http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/list?path=/trunk/fileio/ft_read_headshape.m&start=9251 for change details.

          the change from 27 Feb only pertains to adding a line
          shape = ft_struct2double(shape);
          to the bottom, i.e. not to line 888.

          also the change before that does not explain it.

          Can you provide a bit more details, i.e. which file are you trying to read (or which file is ft_sourceplot trying to read)?

I.e. the file does not exist, and hence ft_read_headshape cannot read it. The error message is a bit cryptic, though.

          The page http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/template/anatomy suggests that other files are to be used for this type of visualization.

          The following documentation should still be updated

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/beamformer
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/beamformingextended

          and the following test scripts

          roboos@mentat001> grep -l surface_l4 *.m
          test_bug2511.m
          test_tutorial_beamformer20120321.m

          test_tutorial_beamformer.m
          test_tutorial_beamforming_extended.m

          @JM, you changed the mat files, could you also do these?

          I completed the test script, replacing the surface file with the correct one. It runs fine and the result looks nice.

          Another fix needed in the test script was that it was not reading the actual data from the mat file. Now it does.

        thetext: OK, I don't think disk space is an issue, but we could still consider only to keep one of the 3 variables in the file. Each of the variables seems equally big and contains the same amount of (15) previous cfg's. I suspect the only way in which they differ is the numeric data (and of course by consequence some of the cfg details).
