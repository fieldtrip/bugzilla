          This is a limitation of Gareth's implementation, which requires the center of the volume conductor to be known. Probably you are using a singleshell model.

          Please first try with a multisphere volume conduction model. See FT_PREPARE_LOCALSPHERES

          If that works, I will consider extending the support to the singleshell.
