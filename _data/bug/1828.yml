          My first hunch is, that the function relies on some baked-in voxel coordinates, which only make sense with a baked-in dimension.

          Let's check...

          hcp-data. do I need to say more? ;-)

          Not obscure at all. 176x256x256 anatomical, with the 176 dimension being the left right axis.

          My early hunch by the way was not correct, but I have been trying to debug this one for the past 2 hours or so. :-(

          align_ctf2spm does not seem to provide a sufficiently close coregistration.

          When the MRI is resliced, the affine registration is improved, but still not perfect.
          It is however good enough for the segmentation to produce a 'normal' output.

          As of yet, this is still quite anecdotal, will upload some data soon.

          OK, it seems that the way spm_affreg is used in align_ctf2spm does not work super-robustly.

          Committed revision 6906.

          added (as of yet) undocumented option opt to ft_convert_coordsys that determines its behavior

          opt = 0: plain coregistration using only approximate fiducial locations
          opt = 1: initial rough estimate followed by spm_affreg
          opt = 2: initial rough estimate followed by spm_normalise


          FIXME: this should be also built into align_itab2spm
