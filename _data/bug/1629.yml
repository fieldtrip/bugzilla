        thetext: "Time to start working on what was proposed a long time ago. Jorn, I added you this , because I (1) partly forgot what we all talked about :), and (2) whether the improvements still fit well with the idea/functionality of the selfun, so please correct me if I'm wrong, and join the discussion on what would be good functionality :).\n\n\nSituation now:\ncfg.selectmode - 'mark' or 'eval'\ncfg.selfun     - when 'eval' above, function name to be executed on selection\ncfg.selcfg     - \n\n\nProposed situation:\ncfg.selectmode - *deprecate*\ncfg.selfun     - as above (allow cell-array for multiple ones)\ncfg.selcfg     - as above (allow cell-array for multiple ones) \n- left-clicking on selection always marks/unmarks\n- right-clicking on selection produces a context menu, containing:\n   * the string name of the function in cellfun\n   * 'standard selfuns'\nThe standard functions should be functions callable with defaults:\n- the 'simplefft' option I added a long time a go, made into browse_XXX\n- browse_topoplotER? (error when no layout), \n- browse_movieplotER? (error when no layout)\n- browse_multiplotER? (error when no layout)\n- browse_topoplotVAR? (error when no layout) (what does this one do, does it makes sense to always be available?)"

        thetext: "Alright, a lot of work has been finished, a lot of features added.\nThe right-click menu fully works now, and has all browsefuns now implemented with basic options. The defaults work for the tutorial data, raw. I also added a browse_simpleFFT that shows a basic fft without tapering, with a toggle button for log/non-log space, and a channel selector. Useful for trying to find bad channels, weird spectral phenomena in the data, etc. Explicitly without tapering.\n\nLeft click is now by default marking stuff, right click is the context menu. Cfg.selectmode has been set to unused. \n\nUser-specified browse-funs are automatically added to the list, and are put on top. When a new figure window is created by the current browse-funs, the figure window name displays characteristics of the data being looked at, e.g. trial number/total, time-point to time-point, etc. \n\nI also activated by default the button for editing preproc settings on the fly.\n\nNew default browse-funs can be easily added.  \n\nWhen cfg.viewmode = vertical, and cfg.ylim = maxabs, the scale has been decreased by a factor of 10 as a default. If this isn't done, the data looks mostly like flat-lines zooming in is mandatory in most cases (see bug 1621)."

        thetext: Add documentation, and use the cfg-checking section to default all current browse-funs, do hard-coding elsewhere.
