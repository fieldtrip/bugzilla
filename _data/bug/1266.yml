        thetext: "Similarly as our CTF data, GDF data is stored in blocks (of 1 gig). To read the data, apparantly the FT implementation does not contain the intelligence yet to concatinate the data chunks. Concatinating after ft_preprocessing would miss intermediate trials as it is unknown how the samples continue between files. \nAnyone have any idea?"

          there are two pieces in the buffer/cpp ODM code where new files are created with a number

          "GDF_BackgroundWriter.h" line 119 of 221
                     char suffix[12];
                      snprintf(suffix,12,"_%i.gdf", fileCounter);
                      filename.append(suffix);


          and in

          "OnlineDataManager.h" line 459 of 764
                  if (fileCounter == 0) {
                      curWriter->start(curFilename.c_str());
                  } else {
                      char *compName = new char[curFilename.size() + 20];
                      sprintf(compName, "%s_S%i", curFilename.c_str(), fileCounter);


          The first seems to be related to the file size, i.e. the automatic splitting of a continuous recording over 1GB files. The second relates to the user stopping and starting saving multiple times, i.e. resulting in files that do not represent a continuous recording.

          So there are

          test.gdf
          test_1.gdf
          test_2.gdf
           ...

          and

          test.gdf
          test_S1.gdf
          test_S2.gdf

          where only the first should be auto-appended in ft_read_xxx

          I cleaned up my bugzilla list by changing the status from resolved (either fixed or wontfix) into closed. If you don't agree, please reopen the bug.
