        thetext: "Testing the CTF realtime processing with rt_eventviewer together with Avgis turned out to be rather slow. The combination of read_header with read_shm_header seems the culprit. It does filetype on ctf_shm, subsequently determines the name of the res4 file, subsequently calls read_header again, which again does filetype. \n\nThe persistent variable argin/argout caching in filetype fails because of the two subsequent calls with different inputs. Read_shm_header relies on read_header for the caching, but repeats the trigger channel detection and write_ctf_shm. Caching should preferably be implemented in read_shm_header itself."
