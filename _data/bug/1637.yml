          Created attachment 297
          top: really crappy version (rev 6430), bottom: qualitatively fix (rev 6431)

          I had strange results when re-analyzing and checked the code with the tutorial data. Given that we know how the planar gradient should look like http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/_media/tutorial/erfplanar.jpg?cache= this is a good way to compare.

          I attached the crappy planar gradient version (rev. 6340)

          I tried to fix it, and changed megplanar_sincos, but results still look a bit different (bottom version of the attached file).

          The fix I provided now definitely fix something, but more might be broken. At least, it's qualitatively the same again, which makes sense given that I fixed a wrong channel order. The problem I fixed only occurs if channel labels get mixed up,

          I made a test script and hopefully fixed that nasty bug

          svn ci ../ft_megplanar.m megplanar_sincos.m -m "bugfix-#1637- does not depend on channel order anymore, cause channel order is forced within the function to tbe the same"

          Sending        private/megplanar_sincos.m
          Transmitting file data ..
          Committed revision 6478.


          didn't commit the test file(s) yet, because I cd to a private directory, which is not a smartass idea ;) gonna fix this tomorrow

          fixed one additional bug that I introduced (note to myself, never commit when you'are about to go home)
          the result does, however, still not look like in the tutorial. cannot find anything wrong with megplanar_sincos nor megplanar, though...
          more strangely, when not using a layout for plotting, the planar data looks like in the bugged version (the upper part of the picture I uploaded). when using ctf151.lay it seems qualitatively close enough
