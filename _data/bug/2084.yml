        thetext: when using ft_sourceanalysis for frequency domain beamforming, it does not object against freqanalysis input that was obtained with cfg.output=’pow’. It just ignores the absent crsspctrm. I know the user has the major responsibility here, but it would be easy to at least give a warning.

          I suggest you go ahead and help out with creating a test script for the specific situation. Probably you have the data right at your fingertips at this moment (otherwise you would not have noticed), for me it requires at least 15 minutes to re-create the situation that is required for testing.

          Please provide a test_bug2048.m script and (when needed) a bug2048.mat file. The mat file can contain some example data (please keep it small) and the test script the cfg and pipeline of function calls.

          (In reply to comment #1)

          sorry, bug2048 should have read bug2084.

        thetext: With the current code, the low-level function prepare_freq_matrices throws an error that states that the cad matrix is incomplete.
