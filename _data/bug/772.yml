          This bug derives from a problem mentioned at the discussion list (Kambiz Tavabi).

          In the user case, ft_multiplotER showed empty axes. In my case (most recent Ft version), an error was thrown saying there was a mismatch between the data and the layout.

          It turns out that cfg.layout = 'neuromag306mag.lay' or 'neuromag306planar.lay' or 'neuromag306all.lay', seem to work fine (*cmb.lay fails). But NM306*.lay layouts do not work.

          When looking into the above mentioned layout files, I see what's causing the problem. The NM306*.lay layouts have different labels, i.e. they say just the number of the channels whereas the neuromag306*.lay layouts have full labels with 'MEG' prefixes.

          In conclusion, the user should try specifying one of the neuromag306*.lay layouts when plotting (and automatic layout selection) neuromag data is problematic.

        thetext: depending on how the data is read (i.e. which with low-level toolbox), the channel labels will be either  "MEG xxx" or "xxx". That is why there are different layouts.
