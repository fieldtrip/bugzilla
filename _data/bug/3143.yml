          sorry about this, Nick.

          I think that the issue you experience is caused by Robert's recent changes to ft_datatype_sens, which now explicitly checks the physical units associated with a particular channel. Long story short, ft_datatype_sens expects this to be well-defined, and not 'unknown', which is the case for the 'COMNT' and 'SCALE' labels in the sens variable that made it into ft_datatype_sens. The reason why these labels are present is due to ft_fetch_sens creating a 'dummy' sens structure from a layout (from a lay file) which annoyingly has these COMNT and SCALE channels represented as separate 'channels'.

          I think that the best way to fix this would be in ft_fetch_sens, i.e. around line 176 (if haslayout...)

          Dear Jan-Matthijs,

          thanks for looking into this and updating the code. I just updated my code to commit 9ad7ed369a9e02f4c2a3c4e085aa167a1183812a (which includes your pull request #178) and the original code now runs fine. However, I do get an error now with a neuromag306 layout. In particular, the following code:

              cfg=struct();
              cfg.layout='neuromag306planar.lay';
              cfg.method='triangulation';
              ft_prepare_neighbours(cfg);

          now gives the following error

              Using the 2-D layout to determine the sensor position
              reading layout from file neuromag306planar.lay
              the call to "ft_prepare_layout" took 0 seconds and required the additional allocation of an estimated 0 MB
              Reference to non-existent field 'tra'.

              Error in ft_datatype_sens (line 290)
                          coil = find(abs(sens.tra(i,:))~=0);

              Error in ft_fetch_sens (line 203)
              sens = ft_datatype_sens(sens);

              Error in ft_prepare_neighbours (line 154)
                  sens = ft_fetch_sens(cfg);

          Using git-bisect again as follows:

              git bisect start
              git bisect bad 9ad7ed369a9e02f4c2a3c4e085aa167a1183812a
              git bisect good 943d2bd6ba88b401987c76d312c0ce7b74db9afe
              git bisect run /Applications/MATLAB_R2015a.app/bin/matlab -r "try,cfg=struct();cfg.layout='neuromag306planar.lay';cfg.method='triangulation';ft_prepare_neighbours(cfg),catch,exit(1);end;exit(0)";

          points to the same commit as in the earlier report:

          To help in debugging: I have made a separate branch [1] of CoSMoMVPA that enabled full regression testing for all 26 layouts known by (supported in) CoSMoMVPA. Since this functionality uses FieldTrip layouts, it may help in assessing to what extent changes in FieldTrip affect its behaviour with respect to dealing with layouts. Indeed, currently Travis reports a failing test [4]

          To run this test, run tests/test_meeg_chan_neighbors.m using either MOxUnit [3] or Matlab's xUnit framework (recently removed from the Matlab file exchange)
