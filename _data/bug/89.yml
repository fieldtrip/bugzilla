I believe that if you\nallowed for the use of spm_bwlabel instead of bwlabeln if the latter is not\navailable, one could use some of your statistics options even without the\nMATLAB Statistics toolbox. (For my purposes, for example, a few\nmodifications in findcluster and clusterstat would be sufficient.)\n\nA nice day to all of you!\nAll the best\n\nAndrea\n************"

          So the implementation is now as follows. The function has yet not been teared apart into two separate function for source and sensor level. Rather the calls to bwlabeln have been removed where possible (<4 dimensions) and been replaced by spm_bwlabel to reduce usage of the image toolbox.

          clusterstat (sourcelevel):
          if length(cfg.dim) == 3
             [output1, output2] = spm_bwlabel(tmp, 6)
          else
             output1 = bwlabeln (tmp, something)
          end

          This used to be the lower call incl bwlabeln only.

          findcluster(sensorlevel):

          [output1, output2 = spm_bwlabel(double(input), 6);

          This used to be:
          [output1, output2 = spm_bwlabel(input, 4);
