          This is a 'trivial' enhancement, feel free to say "won't fix"! :-)

          The spelling of functions sometimes uses American spelling, e.g.

          ft_lateralizedpotential.m
          ft_artifact_*.m

          and other times British spelling, e.g.

          ft_neighbour*.m
          ft_channelnormalise.m

          First step is to decide which spelling. (British, since that is the default for English in the Netherlands?)

          Probably some inconsistencies on the wiki too.

          first: identify as many as possible words which exist in 2 versions.

          then: agree on how it should be


          -check whether it is possible to automatize this:

          compare all code (in fieldtrip and documentation) against an online dictionary and do a brute force replacement.

          if this is not possible, don't do it.

        thetext: "Created attachment 177\ntally of number of uses of british/american spelling throughout wiki and code\n\nSee attached for tally of number of uses in 34 example words.  There exists a bias towards American spelling used overall.   However, in 10/32 words examined, there is a British bias in either the wiki or code or both.\n\nI agree with Eelke that since US spelling is standard in coding, and for example, \nthat Matlab code uses the american spelling of 'color','gray','while' in calling plotting/loop functions, I would suggest to use US.\n\nAside from 'neighbour', which is the biggest UK spelling example within FT, many of the other UK spellings come from the (more) external contributions (SPM, Simbio, gifti, multivariate, etc). I assume FT wouldn't force SPM to use US spelling!"

          found a new one: remove all instances of 'different to' in documentation:
          http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxdiffer.html
          and use 'different from' instead.
