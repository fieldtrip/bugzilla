          Issue with overlapping data and ft_fetch_data and ft_redefinetrial

          there seems to be a problem with ft_redefinetrial and ft_fetch_data when one puts data with overlapping trials.

          I have attached the file testdatafile containing variables testdata and a tmpcfg with a new trial definition.

          check the trial definition of the first trial in testdata and in tmpcfg. It is the same.
          But when u put in ft_redefinetrial the data comes out messed up with a discontinuity!


          %=================================
          load testdatafile testdata tmpcfg
          testdata2 = ft_redefinetrial(tmpcfg, testdata);

          iTrl=1;
          figure; hold on;
          plot(testdata.time{iTrl},testdata.trial{iTrl}(1,:));
          plot(testdata2.time{iTrl},testdata2.trial{iTrl}(1,:),'r');
          %==================================

          I looked into this, and have two observations:

          1) the data is inconsistent in its overlap (probably due to filtering or detrending or so)
          2) ft_fetch_data should have thrown an error, because there's some specific code in place to test for this issue.

          I created a test function, and updated ft_fetch_data, so that now an error is correctly thrown when the test data supplied by Giorgos are used.

          PS: @ Giorgos, why do you not use ft_selectdata in this case, with the option cfg.trials, since you only seem to throw away a few trials completely.

          I am not yet sure whether the issue reported by Giorgos is related to the original reason why this current bug has been filed.

          I have created a branch for this bug in my fork of the repo. I will only pull once I have an idea what's going on here in relation to the original report.

          If you want to use the fixed version of ft_fetch_data, for now you can pull it from https:/github.com/schoffelen/fieldtrip.git (branch bug3379)

          The original reason for this bug report is the fact that test_bug3267 explicitly throws an error in the presence of a sampleinfo field in a timelock structure.

          This has nothing to do with Giorgos' report.

          Rather, it was introduced by me addressing bug 3354

          This one can be closed, because it turned out to be a user error that went undetected because a flaw in the code that was supposed to check for this.
          This has now been addressed, and merged into the FT repo with PR 646
