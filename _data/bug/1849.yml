          Error in ==> fileio\private\read_ctf_cls at 25
          condNumbers = [];

          ??? Output argument "condLabels" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to
          "M:\FieldTrip\trunk\fileio\private\read_ctf_cls.m>read_ctf_cls".

          Error in ==> ft_read_event at 489
              [condNumbers,condLabels] = read_ctf_cls(classfile);

          Independently of the question why the hell I suddenly get this error, I realized that this is causing ft_trialfin_general to return an empty matrix, because ft_read_event fails (and there is a try catch surrounding the ft_read_event_call)

          Simple solution: init the output arguments in read_ctf_cls as empty. This was done once but then commented out - any reason why?


          I wonder though why it all worked on Friday and today it does not (I am working using my local repository and did not update today).

          I see why it was uncommented - because it does lead to some other errors. condLabels needs to be initialized as an empty cell matrix {} not as an empty array [], then it works fine.

          The initial error occurs when the ClassFile.cls of a dataset is empty. Initializing with {} seems to work fine in both cases, when the cls-file is empty and when it has regular content.
