          I just tested the cluster based permutation tutorial for time-frequency data. This is about the actvsBlt plot

          I see nans in the clusterplot (i.e. completely grey), which is caused by a channel being completely 0 (which causes a std of 0 in statfun, and division by 0 = no good). Why does that suddenly constitute a problem?  Seemed to have worked fine... or has the channel not been 0 before, or has been removed?

          (actually, the problem is that griddata cannot interpolate nans and then sets eberything to 0, but I assume that that function did not change, because it's Matlab built-in)

          Have you used the tutorial data?

          because in the preprocessing part some channels are supposed to be disabled:
          % preprocess the data
          cfg.channel   = {'MEG', '-MLP31', '-MLO12'};        % read all MEG channels except MLP31 and MLO12
          cfg.demean    = 'yes';                              % do baseline correction with the complete trial

          dataFIC = ft_preprocessing(cfg);

          I do not know if this helps.

          yep, but it was indeed caused by these two channels

          there was a bug in ft_megplanar. The function tried to interpolate on all channels available in data.grad, which still included the two dismissed channels. I fixed this now in ft_megplanar, and for the FT workshop I excluded these two channels explicitly prior to calling freqstatistics (again)
