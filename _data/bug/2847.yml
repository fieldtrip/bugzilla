        thetext: "Created attachment 701\n.time subfield\n\nHi all,\nI've got a fun one for you.   I've got the following freq structure. \n\nfreq = \n\n        label: {63x1 cell}\n       dimord: 'chan_freq_time'\n         freq: [4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30]\n         time: [1x126 double]\n    powspctrm: [63x14x126 double]\n     labelcmb: {1953x2 cell}\n    crsspctrm: [1953x14x126 double]\n          cfg: [1x1 struct]\n\nI called ft_sourceanalysis with this cfg:\ncfg = \n\n         grid: [1x1 struct]\n          vol: [1x1 struct]\n         elec: [1x1 struct]\n       method: 'dics'\n         dics: [1x1 struct]\n    frequency: [4 6.5000]\n      latency: [-0.6000 0.6000]\n\nThe problem is that the freq.time axis is not exactly evenly spaced; for some reason it seems to have 'eps' added/subtracted to some of the .time values.  \nThe output of ft_sourceanalysis line 289 [data = ft_selectdata(tmpcfg, data)] is: \ndata = \n\n         freq: 5\n         time: -3.6401e-18\n    crsspctrm: [63x63 double]\n          cfg: [1x1 struct]\n        label: {63x1 cell}\n       dimord: 'chan_chan_freq_time'\n\nThe reason for the values of the .freq and .time are that in ft_selectdata/makeselection, the mean of the actually used/selected .freq and .time values is taken.   That is not a problem per se.\n\nBut then just further on in ft_sourceanalysis (line 291) the rollback_provenance changes cfg.frequency from [4 6.5] to [4 6] but leaves cfg.latency unaltered.\n\nThen just further down, (line 297-300) the 'hack' takes the mean of the cfg.latency and cfg.freq, which is *not* the same as the mean of the actual selected values in the data for the time only, but happens to match for freq.\n\nThis causes a crash further on, when prepare_freq_matrices calls ft_selectdata(old) on line 197. (Btw, in this case, this call seems unnecessary as the time & freq has already been selected), with cfg.latency=0 but data.time=-3.6401e-18.\n\nError using nearest (line 58)\nThe limits you selected are outside the range available in the data\n\nError in ft_selectdata_old (line 541)\n    toitmp=nearest(data.time,[seltoi(1) seltoi(2)]);\n\nError in ft_selectdata (line 77)\n  [varargout{1:nargout}] = ft_selectdata_old(varargin{:});\n\nError in prepare_freq_matrices (line 197)\n    freq = ft_selectdata(freq, 'foilim', cfg.frequency, 'toilim', cfg.latency);\n\nError in ft_sourceanalysis (line 461)\n    [Cf, Cr, Pr, Ntrials, cfg] = prepare_freq_matrices(cfg, data);\n \nI've included the .time subfield as an attachment, as that is the relevant part.  One can see it is not exact by\ntime-[-1.2:.02:1.3]"

        thetext: "One might ask: how did I end up with a .time axis that wasn't equally spaced values to begin with?  I don't know, but just type this into Matlab and see what you get:\n\nmean(-.6:.02:.6)  \nmean(-10:.02:10)  \n\nshould be zero but it's not. (on Matlab2013a) I checked with a colleague here (also 2013a) and he had the same weirdness."

        thetext: By now the code has changed quite substantially. I tried to replicate this, but don't manage. I suggest to close for now.
