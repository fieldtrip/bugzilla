        thetext: "The problem is really strange, ‘cause it affects only about 10 files out of 100 of the eeg files I have.\nProbably it has something to do with the number of rejected trails…\n\nI think the problem is in the decoding eeg ns system (int32) in the  \nread_ns_eeg.m  line 72\nit is\n elseif (floor(sample_size)==4) \n\nright now, but in some of my files it might be 5, 7 or even 9.\nSo when I changed this line into\n\nelseif (floor(sample_size)>=4)\n\nthe problem disappeared.\n\nI checked how the files look like after such trick, and it seems to me that everything is perfectly fine with such transformation.

The problem I could not solve is how to load all the trails, including those, marked rejected in Neuroscan to Fieldtrip. The file I attached should contains both rejected and accccepted trails, but by some reasons only accepted is seen in the loaded variable."

          I added the following

          elseif floor(sample_size)>4
            % although this is not to be expected, it might be due to a very large "footer" compared to the data size
            % Olga Sysoeva reported that this extention to the datatype detection fixed it for her (see http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=547)
            datatype ='int32';
            epoch_size = eeg.nchan*eeg.npnt*4 + 13;
          end

          The fixed file will be part of the fieldtrip release this evening
