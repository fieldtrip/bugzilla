        thetext: "Created attachment 770\nscript and example image\n\nDear ft-developers,\nI've noticed something strange and I cannot figure out what the issue is (see example screen shots and analysis pipeline aattached).\n\nI'm not entirely sure this is a bug, but given the recent problem with localspheres maybe this is related?\n\nas can be seen in my screenshot in the attachment, when I beam an erf using the lcmv method with a common filter I get very odd source solutions. \nI noticed this on the group level  (where actually my effect was inverted in polary, and sort of medial).\nthe paradigm is super simple (hit vs. miss of a threshold visual stimulus on the right screen side) with hundreds of trials, thus there should be a quite clear erf for hits, left lateralized. but as i said on group level i get hit < miss and more something medial or, as for the example subject frontal activity.\n\nI tried numerous things \nto name those I still remember:\nleadfield normalisation, regfactor (0/5/10), creating an average from the mom field (which gives interestingly enough a quite different solution but still an odd one), different grids, fixedori, separate filters, longer covariance time window, solutions based on gradiometers/magnetometers/both, i even calculated the covariance by hand, but still all the same.\n\nI think that, if there is a problem and I didn't just kept a typo, then that the problem is somewhere in parts of the code that I do not have the mathematical knowledge to understand....\n\nonly observation is that it seems the source reconstructions of both conditions are dominated by the filter. the covariance/data don't seem to do much.\n\nI put the data and vol/mri in my dropbox:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/9qi0u1xzbmg6as5/AAAkqOxg2odu7-3wMEKHDs1ua?dl=0\n\nsorry for these large data, but I haven't figured out how to simulate good ERF data for gradiometers....\n\nI was considering writing this to the list first, and apologize if it is a mistake on my side.\nBest\nPhilipp\n\np.s.: the data in the dropbox contain gradiometers only, to reduce space"
