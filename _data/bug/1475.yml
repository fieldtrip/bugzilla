          Topo bug

          When plotting using the ft_topoplot** commands the layout is not aligned with the surface, and the comments are also out of alignment.  The screeshots show the problem after the update to ft_plot_topo.m 5715 by eelspa.  Using the code prior to this modification results in a proper output.

        thetext: I recently changed the handling of units of layout files, and a scaling was applied in ft_plot_topo that was ignored in ft_plot_lay, resulting in this mismatch. Everything should be fixed in revision 5787; apologies for any inconvenience.

I now notice that the ft_plot_lay function also plots boxes and text without using the corresponding functions but using local code instead. Probably that is more efficient. It should be checked that the 2D locations are identical. I suggest to make a test script that takes a template layout and passes it (with random potential data) through the following functions:\n  ft_plot_box.m\n  ft_plot_lay.m\n  ft_plot_line.m\n  ft_plot_text.m\n  ft_plot_topo.m\n  ft_plot_vector.m\n  ft_plot_matrix.m\n  ft_plot_montage.m\n\nAll graphical outputs should be nicely aligned."
