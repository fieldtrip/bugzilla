          Hi,

          Is there any plan to have this patch be integrated in fieldtrip repository? We'd like to know when we can remove the patched code we have here.

          Thanks in advance

          Jean

          Dear Amelie and Jean,

          Could one of you explain why this patch is needed? I don't quite understand what new functionality is provided.

          Best,

          Boris

          Hi Boris,

          We compiled a fieldtrip buffer library. From a main program, we instanciate a fieldtrip server. As we let user change the port used for connection, we need to have a way to stop and restart the server cleanly.

          The patch Amelie provided makes it possible to do so. Without the patch, the only way to stop the server was to kill its thread. Then, some objects are not released cleanly and trying to instantiate a new server leads to behavioural problems.

          Thank you for your elaboration. We discussed the proposal, and we definitely want to include this functionality! It might take some time however, since the mutex use in the buffer were recently improved --- so we have to be careful that this patch is applied cleanly.

          Best,

          Boris

          Hi,

          Sorry, but I can't tell, I'm not using Matlab at all (I am only working with C++ programs).

        thetext: Yes, I see this is still the present in your latest code. There is a function to create a TCP server (tcpserver), but there is no function to destroy/close it. Then, the same process cannot create one, destroy it and then create a new one.
