          I see on
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dashboard
          and in
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dashboard/r8776/test_ft_componentanalysis
          that test_ft_componentanalysis is now randomly failing/succeeding on subsequent executions.

          I don't know whether it is related to this change, but could you perhaps check?

          hehehe, and we're just trying to do a pca on the data. What seems to happen (more or less at random) is that the polarity of the components is flipped. Does svd/eig have a random behavior in this?

          and the question then would be: why did this not show up before?

          one way to ensure a no-fail here would be to feed the random number generator with the random seed that was used to construct the data on disk

          test function runs through on matlab2011b, but not on matlab2012b

          the testdata stored on disk seems to have been created with matlab2013a

        thetext: Given that fact that the current Matlab version that is used to do the regression testing is 2012b, I recomputed and saved the component data with this version. I also updated the test-function. Since the cause of the failing test function is a numeric issue based on the Matlab version, it may need to be followed up in another bug, the randomseed functionality seems to be OK.
