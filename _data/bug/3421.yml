          Hi sirs,

          I get an error mentioning that 'a conductivity value should be specified for each compartment' when I run ft_prepare_headmodel with a segmented mri. This mri file has 5 segments and a value for each, but it fails.

          The file I'm using as segmentedmri is accessible here.
          https://www.sendspace.com/file/1qis50

          I'm running the command
          hdm = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, segmentedmri);
          and cfg only has the field conductivity ([0.33 0.14 1.79 0.01 0.43]).

          Thank you for your attention.
          Gon√ßalo

        thetext: "This bug report is incomplete and poor in quality.\n\nBesides the data that can be downloaded contains an MRI image with 'brain', 'skull' 'scalp' and 'anatomy', so it's not clear why you think this should work with an arbitrary number of conductivities specified.\n\nI change the status to wontfix, until you are able to \n\n- motivate what you try to achieve\n- document what you have done, and what the specific error is that you get\n- describe what you have tried to solve it yourself\n- upload some data and code that allows us to reproduce your problem"
