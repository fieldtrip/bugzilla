          I have tracked the issue to Twitter giving us the message "rate limit exceeded". This should not happen, as our rate limit is 350 requests per hour, and the script caches results so that not more than one request every 40 seconds is executed.

          I have opened a topic on the Twitter developer forums on this:
          https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/14732

          Robert, it could be that you will receive e-mails when people post replies there, as I checked the "E-mail notification" box for that thread. I guess your e-mail address registered with the FT twitter account?

          Found out the issue:

          The permissions of the cache file had changed, such that the cache could not be updated by the PHP script anymore. Therefore, of course the cache remained stale, such that the PHP script made excessive new requests (on every PHP script execution), thereby exceeding the rate limit. I think the rate limit exceed should disappear once the permissions of the cache file are fixed.

          I contacted Marek (adding as CC to this bug) about the permissions and he will look into it.

        thetext: "This is a consequence of the DCCN webserver hack of about a month ago, which had as consequence that malicious code was added to some fieldtrip php files. I did a chmod/chown on all files to prevent it from happening again (since the vector of attack was not found). I only opened those files for apache write permission that I deemed necessary. I clearly missed this one.\n\nI have just done\nroboos@dccn-l005> sudo chown apache: tweetcache.txt \nand hope that this is enough."

          I used to have writing rights to all FT wiki files, can this be arranged again?

          (On my own webservers, I always make a group 'access' to which I add myself (and possibly other admins) and the apache user, then I give group write rights to all files/folders.)

          (In reply to comment #3)

          I have done

          roboos@dccn-l005> find -type f -uid 1064 -exec chown :fieldtrip {} \;
          roboos@dccn-l005> find -type d -uid 1064 -exec chown :fieldtrip {} \;
          roboos@dccn-l005> find -type f -uid 1064 -exec chmod g+w {} \;
          roboos@dccn-l005> find -type d -uid 1064 -exec chmod g+w {} \;

          in the fieldtrip directory, where uid=1064 is me. This should also grant you access. Please close this bug if you consider it resolved.
