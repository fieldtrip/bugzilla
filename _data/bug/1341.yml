        thetext: "Repeatedly, people report problems when running the tutorials. They specify cfg.dataset = 'Subject01.ds', then enter the Subject01.ds directory, and get an error in trialfun_general (which is not immediately leading to the cause of the problem (see below)). The obvious reason is that they are in the wrong directory (-> should we consider making this more robust????), but the direct cause is a crash in trialfun_general, that assumes at some point the event-structure being a proper structure, rather than being empty (when a reading failure such as above occurs). \nI see a few solutions (possibly not mutually exclusive):\n\n\n1 make the path issue for .ds datasets more robust (other parts of the code may also benefit)\n2 throw an error in trialfun_general when event-reading fails (and when it is needed according to the cfg)\n3 check for isempty(event) in trialfun_general before treating it as a structure\n\n\n\n\n\ncfg = [];                                           % empty configuration\ncfg.dataset                 = 'Subject01.ds';       % name of CTF dataset  \ncfg.trialdef.eventtype      = 'backpanel trigger';\ncfg.trialdef.prestim        = 1;\ncfg.trialdef.poststim       = 2;\ncfg.trialdef.eventvalue     = 3;                    % event value of FIC\ncfg = ft_definetrial(cfg); \n\nWarning: no trialfun was specified, using trialfun_general \n\n> In ft_definetrial at 123\nevaluating trialfunction 'trialfun_general'\n\nWarning: adding\n/Users/jessamynorton-ford/Documents/MATLAB/fieldtrip-20120222/external/ctf\ntoolbox to your Matlab path \n\nreadCTFds: Data set error : size of meg4 file(s)\n\t\t         0 bytes (from dir command)\n\t\t 179071200 bytes (from res4 file)\n\nreading the events from 'Subject01.ds/Subject01.res4'\n\nreadCTFds: Data set error : size of meg4 file(s)\n\t\t         0 bytes (from dir command)\n\t\t 179071200 bytes (from res4 file)\n\n???

          To make it more robust, one could probably do something like this:

          % check whether the dataset is somewhere on the path
          x = which(cfg.dataset);
          cfg.dataset = x;

          (I just type this without having actually tried it).
