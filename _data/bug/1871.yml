          or better even: use struct2double instead ;-)

          no, only the part that needs to be double should be double, not the whole struct. So struct2single for testing, and then double on the required items ;-P

          why would we care -> because of memory.

          You are implying that the input struct to ft_xxxplot is converted with struct2double. That input can contain single trial data, since averaging will be done on the fly. So the input structure can be large, even at single precision, converting that to double will double (no pun intended) the RAM requirements.

          Also, the actual problem is in the ft_plot_xxx function in the plotting module, not in the main ft_xxxplot functions. The low-level ft_plot_xxx does not get structures as input, but only the arrays it needs to plot. So those arrays should be converted where needed and struct2double does not come into play there. Also, the ft_plot_xxx functions should be callable by the end user, and we don't expect the end user to be converting it.

It was due to ft_senslabel returning its output as a single 306x1 long vector rather than a 102x3 matrix. \n\nThat is my fault in trying to address bug #1919.
