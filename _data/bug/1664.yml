          This is a result of bug 805

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/what_are_the_different_neuromag_and_yokogawa_layouts_good_for

          Robert:
          It was suggested by Annika to cover MEG instrumentation in one of the upcoming
          EDA meetings. Perhaps this is something to address there as well. The
          consequence of discussing this is that the understanding of the hardware
          consequences on the interpretation of the data would be improved.

In general it was agreed that some documentation regarding the different coil configurations would be warranted. Also, it has been mentioned that perhaps the issue concerning the layouts should move to the getting started sections of the Yoko/Neuromag respectively...'
