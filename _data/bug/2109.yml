        thetext: Currently when a raw .fif file is read by ft_preprocessing, any SSP vectors in the .fif file are also stored in the data structure under data.hdr.orig.projs.  There was some discussion about this on the listserv in the recent past.  At the moment there doesn't seem to be a method in fieldtrip to apply these projectors.  The data structures are a bit different but there may be something helpful in mne's mne_make_projector.m.

        thetext: We have ft_denoise_pca and ft_denoise_synthetic, which are for BTi/4d and CTF data respectively. It may make sense to model a new ft_denoise_ssp function after these two.

        thetext: I suggest to close this for now. Apparently there has been no strong need for this functionality. Let's reopen if this becomes 'actueel' again.
