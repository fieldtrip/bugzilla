          I'm using fieldtrip-20101216 on Matlab 2010b on a Mac Pro running OS X 10.6.5.

          I'm surprised I'm finding this bug because statfun_depsamplesT seems like such a basic function. I hope I'm not doing something wrong, but I don't think I am because I encounter this problem when running ft_timelockstatistics in the event related statistics tutorial: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/eventrelatedstatistics

          The issue seems to be that the count for units of observation is incorrect in statfun_depsamplesT. Specifically, when there are 2 conditions (cfg.uvar=2), when nunits is calculated on line 60, it counts each subject twice.

          I believe line 60 in statfun_depsamplesT should be: nunits = length(unique(design(cfg.uvar,:)));
          When I make this change, the results are the same as when using matlab's ttest (seen in the eventrelatedstatistics tutorial).

          Hi Matt, I reproduced the issue. With me it actually leads to a crash...
          I fixed it (don't know how and when it was introduced however, because it seemed to work just fine).
          Should be available as of tonight (CET) at out ftp-server. Thanks for reporting it. Could you check whether it works for you and then close the bug? Thanks

          JM

          This now works for me with fieldtrip-20101219.

          I guess this was just a mistake in the script, but it's weird (and scary) that something like this could be changed without noticing the bug... Anyway thanks for implementing the change quickly.

          Best,
          Matt
