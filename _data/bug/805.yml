          currently it has overlapping channels for the planar gradiometers, whereas it should resemble the NM306all.lay layout. I suggest to also make separate layouts for

          yokogawa440all.lay

          sorry for the delay

          the 440all layout represents the current 440 layout, so I assume that the old yokogawa layouts should get removed?

          apart from that, the layouts look alright and I'll add them

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #7)\n\nNope, it will need some additional work. \n\nIt was suggested by Annika to cover MEG instrumentation in one of the upcoming EDA meetings. Perhaps this is something to address there as well. The consequence of discussing this is that the understanding of the hardware consequences on the interpretation of the data would be improved."
