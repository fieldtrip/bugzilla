It kills every browser I've tried as well as every PDF reader â€“ after I've saved the document to PDF. All the other pages on the fieldtrip site that I've tried work flawlessly. \n\nThank you in advance,\n\nBest regards,\n\nPhilip J. Monahan\nPostdoctoral Researcher BCBL\nwww.bcbl.eu"

        thetext: I can confirm that the page crashes both firefox and safari on Mac OS X. When asking Stephen (CC, who made the page) it turned out that on his Windows PC with Chrome it worked ok (albeit a bit slow). The problem is in the svn-format graphics. I will recreate the figures in an other way.

          I recreated the three figures with the trigger channel from the original data and saved them as PNG bitmaps. Now the page displays properly in Safari and Firefox. I have not tested Chrome, IE or Opera.

           There remains one (original vector line drawing) as SVG format.
