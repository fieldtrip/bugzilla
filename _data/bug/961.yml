        thetext: In the new 'help' documentation, cfg.artfctdef.ecg.interactive was added, but in the code it was named cfg.artfctdef.ecg.feedback, hence leading to a crash as the user doesn't know to specify the feedback option based on help documentation.  It seems in this case it is an 'interactive' rather than 'feedback' so I will change the code to match the documentation (calling it .interactive).

        thetext: Sorry, I mean that 'interactive' was already accounted for in the if ~isfield(...) section, so I will change later mention of .feedback to .interactive, as well as add .interactive to the help at the top (saying that 'yes' is default).

        thetext: sorry about the confusion. I needed the option to be able to do test_ft_artifact_xxx without the user interaction. Please make the option and/or documentation consistent with whatever is done in zvalue (and please check that test_ft_artifact_xxx still runs).

        thetext: ft_artifact_zvalue uses 'feedback' so I'll set *ecg to use the same (not 'interactive').   and test_ft_artifact_xxx still runs fine.
