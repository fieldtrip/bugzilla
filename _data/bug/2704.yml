          The actual figure is missing the figure caption is there though. Might be due to the wiki update?

          Yep, I just thought it is due to the wiki update.

          I'll start a browse to see whether some other figs are missing

        thetext: I managed to make the page go completely empty, trying to insert the link (after re-uploading the figure, because I couldn't find it back). Sorry about this, but I don't know how to proceed from here.

          I am not happy. Instead of seeing the image, I see a link to potatomen.svg, when I click on it, it says file not found (linking to http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/_media/faq/mri_orinetation/potatomen.svg)
          Is it browser/svg related? I am using FF 54)
