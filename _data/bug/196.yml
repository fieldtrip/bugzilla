          Function isrow() is a Matlab builtin starting with version R2010b:
              http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/rn/bsk8h3i-1.html
              http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/isrow.html

          Initializing FieldTrip under Matlab R2010b results in such errors:
              Warning: Function <path>/external/afni/isrow.m
              has the same name as a MATLAB builtin. We suggest
              you rename the function to avoid a potential name
              conflict.

          I have already reported this issue to AFNI developers, hopefully they will remove isrow.m in a few years' time.

          In the meanwhile, do you know if removing external/afni/isrow.m is OK? Is this function eventually called by FieldTrip?

          The AFNI developers have sent me this mail:

          	I just renamed isrow to be is_row.m . The afni_src.tgz
          	postdating this message will contain the fix.
          	In the meanwhile, it would be easiest for you to change
          	the few occurrences of isrow in the *.m files to is_row,
          	and mv isrow.m to is_row.m

          Downloading the latest AFNI Matlab library should fix the problem.

          Dear Dimitri,

          I replaced the afni directory with a more recent version. could you check whether this works for you and report back to me through bugzilla? Thanks, Jan-Mathijs
