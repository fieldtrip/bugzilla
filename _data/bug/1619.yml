          when inputting a cfg without a vol-structure. The function crashes upon execution of ft_fetch_vol.
          However, some methods do not require a vol to be present in the input.

          I now circumvented this with a try-catch, also for the ft_fetch_sens call later on.

          Verify whether this is OK for you.

        thetext: "that's fine - it's the same as in ft_prepare_headmodel. \nwe could modify ft_fetch_XXX such that it returns an empty structure, though I prefer the try-catch statement (so that users get an appropriate error message for functions that do need sens or vol). what do you think?"

          I agree.

          Probably the cleaner solution then would be to check whether the particular method in ft_prepare_sourcemodel actually needs a vol/sens.

          For now I can very well live with the try catch solution, and rely on the subsequent code to catch the error when the vol/sens is actually needed
