        thetext: this will make it unnecessary to do a pen-and-paper step selecting the components for rejection. Would be neat!

          Plan is to do this by making use of the event structure iso the artifact stucture. This event structure has the option to apply to specific channel (by putting channame in ".type" field). Some functionality to do this is already available in convert_event. What has to be done to make this possible is:
          - make databrowser also understand events (now it can only draw a line at event time, it has to be also able to deal with event.duration and event.type).
          - make reject_artifact also be able to deal with events, and with notion to remove channels and not only time.

          Taking on the last know bug in existence. ..

          And pausing ;). Eelke (CC), how are you doing with the overhaul on the artifact definition? I.e. bug 1304?

          (In reply to comment #2)
          Sorry, haven't really worked on that for some time. Will take it up in the near future again. If I recall correctly, I actually did quite some work on it already. I'm marking this bug as a "depends on" for mine.

        thetext: the input to ft_databrowser is a cfg.channel, the output could also have a cfg.channel, reflecting the latest state of the selected channels that are in view (i.e. with the channel selection GUI). That makes it consistent with ft_rejectvisual.
