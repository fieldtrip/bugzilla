        thetext: so as I understand it, the DMLT mex files are partially computed with MSVC C++ 2008 and partially with 2010, and require both  the msvcr90.dll (for 2008) and a similar dll for 2010 compiled mex files. Is this right? What is the name of the dll that is needed when using the 2010 compiler and where to get it?

          Hi Ali,

          Could you write a FAQ on what to do when DMLT mex files give a problem? As I understand it, recompiling is not needed, only installing the msvcr90.dll file (for 2008) and/or the msvcrXXX.dll file (for 2010) are needed.

          Many people will not be able to recompile, as they do not have administrative rights to install software (such as the free MSVC 2008 or 2010 editions) on their windows computer. It would be nice if those people are still able to use DMLT.

          Marek told me that they have installed the 64bit c++ redist of Microsoft.

          And I noticed that the FAQ associated to the mex problem for windows 64 bit is already there. So I just added a second part to it other than making another FAQ.

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #4)\n\n> Marek told me that they have installed the 64bit c++ redist of Microsoft.\n\nyes, they did so on the computers used in the course. those were afterwards (i.e. after the toolkit) re-imaged with a linux installation to be used in the cluster. So it was a temporary fix only.\n\nThe FAQ is meant for external users, not for those at the Donders (DCCN and DCC). At the Donders we use linux most of the time anyway, but outside Nijmegen there are many non-linux users. \n\nIf the mex files for windows users don't work out of the box, we'd better remove them and then point to the compile instructions. Shipping fieldtrip+dmlt with broken mex files that require recompilation does not meet my expectations.\n\n @Marcel: what do you suggest? Document how to use these specific mex files or remove the mex files from svn and tell people that they have to recompile them?"
