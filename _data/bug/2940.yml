          If the matlab session on an execution host accepts and reads in a job it deletes the input.mat file immediately, i.e. before the job was successfully completed. However, if the matlab-session crashes, then the torque/maui/moab will reschedule and rerun the job on a different host. Then the matlab session will fail because it cannot find the (deleted) input.mat file.

          Proposed solution:
          Make 'rerunable' an option in qsubcellfun and if rerunable==true then only delete the input.mat file at the very end of the job

        thetext: Just to be clear, I come across this problem all the time because (massive multi-core) nodes keep crashing and after a reboot of the node, torque reschedules the job to another node (and then matlab gives the missing input.mat file error).
