          If you have a look at e.g. the source for one of the tutorials, you can see some examples of how to include tags; it's done by using something like {{tag>tutorial qsub peer distcomp matlab}} at the top of the page. Just think of a name for each specific dataset, and add that tag to each page that references it.

          On the overview page, you can make the list of links like so:
          {{topic>mytag &list}}

          Hi Martin (CC), can you give some details on the spike dataset? A sentences words and potentially a link to a publication would be great. See previous comments if you want to know the context of the question.

          hi Robert - this is just a standard hippocampal dataset in which a rat runs around on a maze and you gather place fields in CA1. It's one cell from an unpublished dataset.

          Hi Nietzsche,

          happy new year ;)
          In light of bug 2311, I gotta promote an example script to a tutorial. It's about this example script:
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/preprocessing_eeg
          which uses the same dataset as the continuous preprocessing tut

          btw: if you set the status of your bugs to 'assigned', you get one mail per day less from the bugzilla page ;)

          @ Jörn,

          I'm reading through the new EEG tutorial and noticed several places that were copy pasted from the corresponding MEG tutorial - I will go through and update it (e.g., places where it says 'MEG" it should say "EEG") if you don't mind?

          I had to post here because I couldn't find a bug under your name that talks about upgrading the example script into a tutorial.

          N.

        thetext: "the data sets have (mostly) been tagged and listed on http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/what_types_of_datasets_and_their_respective_analyses_are_used_on_fieldtrip\n\nthe EEG preprocessing example/tutorial has recently been reviewed by me and some small issues (name of wiki, ftp location, test script) were fixed. \n\nI think that concludes this bug. Of course there remains maintenance to be done, but that is just daily work, not a project."
