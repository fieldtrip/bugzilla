        thetext: "This was detected by test_tutorial_coherence, which threw an error when trying to plot chancmb data using ft_multiplotER. \n\nIt fails in ft_selectdata_old on line 572, stating, 'not yet implemented'. It refers to selecting channel combinations when data.label is not present. The call is performed on output by ft_connectivityanalysis, which doesn't have a data.label field.\n\nAs this is a test_script for the tutorial, and thus it would have worked before, I assume one of the two following has occured:\n\n1) ft_connectivityanalysis previously had a output.label field in output, next to labelcmb.\n\n2) ft_selectdata previously was able to select chancmbs without a data.label field. \n\nJM, I added you to the bug as case #1 seems a bit more likely than case #2. Was the field removed from the output by any chance?"

          This bug is introduced by a change in ft_multiplotER -> around line 271.

          ft_selectdata has never been able to select channels from bivariate data

          ft_connectivityanalysis has never outputted data with a label, if the numeric data is represented as linearly indexed label combinations.

          fixed it in ft_multiplotER -> the channel selection handling for bivariate data is done lower in the code

          fixed with revision 5660.
