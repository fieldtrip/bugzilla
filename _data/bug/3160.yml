          ft_sourceanalysis has a problem when supplying a cfg.grad which is based on more sensors than are in the data, i.e. the latter only containing gradiometers. This is because I lose my grad when I combine data sets, so I retrieve it from a previous dataset, that also has more channels (i.e. magnetometers as well).

          It ends up breaking at:

          --------------
          Error using reshape
          To RESHAPE the number of elements must not change.

          Error in ft_sourceanalysis (line 645)
              Cf  = reshape(Cf , [1 Nchans Nchans]);
          --------------

          This is because it created the headmodel as well as a cfg previously (line 344, ft_sourceanalysis):

          % collect and preprocess the electrodes/gradiometer and head model
          [headmodel, sens, cfg] = prepare_headmodel(cfg, data);

          Which was used to determine the number of channels (line 357, ft_sourceanalysis):
          % It might be that the number of channels in the data, the number of
          % channels in the electrode/gradiometer definition and the number of
          % channels in the localspheres volume conduction model are different.
          % Hence a subset of the data channels will be used.
          Nchans = length(cfg.channel);

          And that is because ft_fetch_sens (line 53, prepare_headmodel) returned both gradiometers and magnetometers, i.e. 306 sensors, based on the cfg.grad structure (there is no grad in the data):

          % get the gradiometer or electrode definition, these can be in the cfg or in the data
          sens = ft_fetch_sens(cfg, data);

          Now, I don't know if this is a bug, or just my problem. I should ofcourse be able to solve this by taking my reference data, and running selectdata on that. It's just that it takes another couple of Gig of memory to do so. Also, it seems that the 'subset of data channels' is perhaps wrongly implemented.

          Perhaps there is a way for me to do something like ft_selectdata or ft_fetch_sens to select channels for grad output?


          Cheers,
          Stephen

          als ik doe:

          load bug3160
          data = common_FFT; % 'k snap niet waarom mensen altijd creatief willen zijn met variable names

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method = 'dics';
          cfg.frequency = data.freq;
          cfg.headmodel.o = [0 0 4];
          cfg.headmodel.r = 8; % je moet iets, supplied data is tamelijk minimaal
          cfg.grid.resolution = 1;

          source = ft_sourceanalysis(cfg, data);

          % this works without problems for me, on my git-repo, pulled from upstream master yesterday.

          I hope not, because this would mean that you use ft_combineplanar prior to sourceanalysis, which is not good.
