        thetext: "The ft_plot_vector function has\n\n%   highlight       = a logical vector of size Y, where 1 means that the corresponding values in Y are highlighted (according to the highlightstyle)\n%   highlightstyle  = can be 'box', 'thickness', 'saturation', 'difference' (default='box')\n\nIt makes sense to extend this with \n\nhighlight = boolean or scalar valued vector of size Y\nhighlightstyle = errorbar, confidence, ...\n\nwhere errorbar would at each data point make an upward and downward whisker line, and confidence would make a grey zone around the line.\n\nThese low-level options are mapped to cfg.maskstyle and cfg.maskparameter in ft_singleplotER., so that function does not have to be extended (except for the documentation).\n\nI suggest you implement it yourself. The \n\nswitch highlightstyle\n  case 'box'\n  case 'thickness'\n...\n\nin ft_plot_vector should be easy to extend. Please make a test and demo script and also see fieldtrip/test/test_bug1447.m  and bug #1447."

        thetext: Change status for now. There was no major progress on this bug, and the reporter did not find it urgent enough to push it. Feel free to re-open once if Martin can assign it to somebody who wants to implement it, or when a git pull request for an improved version of ft_plot_vector is available
