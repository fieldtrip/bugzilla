          Is it possible filter in-memory extracted trials data with mirroring at the
          edges?

          When I try:

          % filter
          cfg = [];cfg.lpfilter = 'yes';
          cfg.lpfreq = '40';
          cfg.lpfilttype ='but';
          cfg.padtype = 'mirror';
          % trial length is 1.1s so mirror-pad to1.5s (200ms each side)
          cfg.padding = 1.5;
          flt_data = ft_preprocessing(cfg, block_data);

          I get:

          Reference to non-existent field 'Fs'.

          Error in ft_preprocessing (line 288)
                padding = round(cfg.padding * data.Fs);

          Adding block_data.Fs = block_data.fsample; seems to work. But in the
          resulting data structure the time vectors no longer match the trial data,
          so obviously something is going wrong:

          >> size(block_data.time{1})

          ans =

               1   560

          >> size(block_data.trial{1})

          ans =

             234   560

          >> size(flt_data.trial{1})

          ans =

             234   560

          >> size(flt_data.time{1})

          ans =

               1   357

          This is using SVN r8075.
          block_data is the result of ft_appenddata of several individual runs.

        thetext: "Created attachment 468\ncorrected for in-memory data - is this correct for data on disk as well?\n\nHi Robin,\n\nin the meanwhile I found that the error is because the number of padded samples also get deducted from the time-axis, while time-axis did not get padded. So that was an easy fix, see attachment. \nI just wonder whether the same fix that I applied for data in memory has to be applied for data on disk. The attached version applies the same fix for data on disk, but I am not sure whether this is the correct thing to do. I will still have to do some sanity checks for this. However, your bug should be fixed with this version."

          Hi Robin,

          whoops, I thought this was fixed, but I just checked and realized it is not. I fixed all this padding stuff now, should work in the version from tomorrow onwards. Sorry for the long delay.
