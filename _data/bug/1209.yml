          The following was posted to the FieldTrip mailing list:
          --
          After letting the server run for a while (see below size at 512hz), I
          get an "err3":

          data:
          size = 176960 x 34
          dmarequest: err3
          Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Error returned from
          FieldTrip buffer server.
                 at nl.fcdonders.fieldtrip.BufferClient.readResponse(BufferClient.java:646)
                 at nl.fcdonders.fieldtrip.BufferClient.getEvents(BufferClient.java:386)
                 at testclient.main(testclient.java:71)



          Any ideas?

          Thanks,
          Jake

          Ok, seems like it has to do with exceeding the maximum number of
          samples.  Not sure what to do here though yet:

          Dear Jacob,

          Could your provide some addition details, so that we can reproduce your bug? Specifically:
          - What operating system do you use
          - Which Java version(s)
          - Steps you use to start the fake BioSemi client and the Java reader.

          Best regards,

          Boris Reuderink

          Dear Jake,

          This bug is still open. Have you solved the problem in the meantime? If so, how? If not, could you provide some addition details so we can look into this issue?

          Best regards,

          Boris

        thetext: "Hi Boris,  \n\nSorry for the delay, I was moving overseas.  I will only be able to start getting into this again after the next few weeks as I have another project.\n\nSoon I will try to reproduce the error again on my computer, but if I recall correctly if you simply start the biosemi2ft server and let it run for a while (let's say 10 minutes), then you will get this error in the Java client.  \n\nI believe it might even work with the fakebiosemi2ft client...\n\nMore to come soon.  I've actually fixed quite a few bugs in a few of your files that I will post once I get the system more robust."

          Hi Jake,

          We are very much interested in your improvements. Even if you don't have time to respond, could you sent your changes? That might already be informative.

          Best regards,

          Hi Boris,  Sure thing!  I will send the changes to you soon.  I am working on a real time classifier with biosemi and had to add some catches in for proper handling of triggers when trigger timing is very fast.  I am working with the code today so I will send it to you soon.

          Best regards,
          Jake
