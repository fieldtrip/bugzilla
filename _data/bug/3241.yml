        thetext: "I put some effort into making a list of only passing test scripts, but nevertheless am encountering some test scripts that fail. I believe that might be due to some randomness on the environment with which jobs are started or on the compute nodes.\n\nThese are the ones that will be reported in the automatic dashboard email tomorrow.\n\n97dd149/test_bug1742.txt\nsubmitting job roboos_dccn_c021_p5492_b1_j001...=== test_bug1742 FAILED in 0 seconds\n\n97dd149/test_bug2524.txt\n=== test_bug2524 FAILED in 2 seconds\n\n97dd149/test_tutorial_networkanalysis.txt\n=== test_tutorial_networkanalysis FAILED in 220 seconds  \n\nThe first is a qsubcellfun test, which fails because matlab2016b cannot be found.

The files are in /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp/tutorial/networkanalysis/. I will add that path to the test script with an explicit dccnpath."

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #0)

          this change is to the dashboard code:

          roboos@mentat002> git commit -a
          [master 79fdfd6] load the required modules, see http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3241
           1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)

          this change is to the third FT test script mentioned above:

          roboos@mentat002> git commit -a
          [master ecf6001] ENH - go to the correct directory where the data is located prior to loading. See http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3241
           1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)

          I hope this resolves it. The test run of this evening (linked to the ftp release) has already started. I'll start a separate schedule-tests.sh batch with the latest version (7bb1c24) of the master branch.
