        thetext: "hi, \n\nI wanted to apply average mastoids reference derivation on my EEG data. The data recorded at each channel is already referenced to the left mastoid (LM), and now I would like to include also the right mastoid in the reference, so I have to re-reference my data.\n\nBut when I use this configuration of ft_preprocessing:\n\ncfg.reref='yes';\ncfg.refchannel='RM';\n\nit just simply subtracts RM from each data-point: a'=a-RM. However, I think this is not correct because RM has been already referenced also to LM. Therefore, only RM/2 should be subtracted from each data-point (a'=a-(RM/2)). I can circumvent this problem with using the montage option, but I guess it would be nice to explain this also to other users.\n\nLilla"

          I just have discussed this with Robert.
          It can be done like this:
          cfg=[];
          cfg.implicitref='LM';
          cfg.refchannel={'RM','LM'};
