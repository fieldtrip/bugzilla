          Using the latest SVN version of FILE-IO two files could not be read.
          Both files are available at

          I have tested the edf file. The native fieldtrip edf reader reports that the annotation channel is in a different sampling rate, which is not supported. When specifying dataformat=biosig and headerformat=biosig, and adding the latest (svn) version of biosig to my matlab path, I can read in the edf test file with read_header and read_data (and hence all other FT functions). It then reports that all channels are at 1000 Hz. I don't know what biosig does with the annotation channel, perhaps set it to zeros.

          I have not tested the other file, because I was not able to doenload it.

          the *.edf test file is very similar to one that I just got from EGI, i.e. the way that EGI converts their data to EDF+ results in an annotation channel (as last channel) with a different sampling date.

          I have made an update to read_edf which allows the data from the consistent channels to be read in this case).

          The *.bdf problem should be solved by reading the file with dataformat='biosig' and 'headerformat='biosig. and by using a recent version of biosig (which includes the fix).
