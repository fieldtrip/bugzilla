          Example of sparse raster plot with 85/1289 trials selected

          Since the a trial selection with cfg.trials doesn't alter the actual trial numbers the resulting raster plot can look very sparse, depending on the number of selected trials. Since this is not the actual neuronal behavior there should be an option to remove the 'empty' trials from the plot.

        thetext: I'm not so sure about this one - the original idea was that you can use this feature to plot multiple conditions in one raster. If you want to avoid this, you can simply select the trials beforehand and then enter this struct into the raster plot.

          (In reply to comment #1)

          That doesn't solve the problem because ft_spike_select doesn't alter the trial numbers but just removes the ones not in a selected trial

          ...
            spike.trial{iUnit} = spike.trial{iUnit}(spikesInTrial);
          ...

          If this is intended behavior I'm fine with that, but it should be clearly documented. As an easy workaround, I can recommend the third output argument of unique, e.g. like


          [~, ~, renumberedTrials] = unique(spike.trial{iUnit})
