        thetext: right now ft_preproc_derivative deals with the padding that is needed after taking the diff, but the gradient function can do that automatically.

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

          actually, gradient does not do padding, it is just computing the derivative in a different way (implicitly extrapolating). Next it behaves differently from diff.

          Executive decision needed.

          (In reply to comment #3)

          make a test script to better illustrate the differences and commonalities between diff and gradient ('extrapolate' at edges?)

          add optionality for 'case gradient' to preproc_derivative?

          x = rand(1,100)
          y1 = (ft_preproc_derivative(x, 1, 'beg') + ft_preproc_derivative(x, 1, 'end'))/2
          y2 = gradient(x)
          plot(y1)
          hold on
          plot(y2, 'r.')

          QED, see attached.

          Conclusion: it is the same, except at the edges. Note that equivalence for order 1 implies equivalence for order N, because that would just be n-fold application of an equivalent algorithm

So the entire functionality can be reduced to something like this:\n\nfor i=1:order\n  A = gradient(A);\nend\n\nThis requires tweaking of the varargin settings. ft_preproc_derivative now desires 3 input variables; data, order, padding (i.e. type, e.g. 'beg', 'end'). \n\nShould be build in support for this now defined older implementation or simply change this to a 2-variable-input in high-level functions accordingly?"

          It seems only preproc in fieldtrip/private calls ft_preproc_derivative (unix cmd: grep ft_preproc_derivative *.m).

          I have changed the number of input arguments in preproc from 3 to 2 accordingly, as padding is no longer needed in ft_preproc_derivative.
