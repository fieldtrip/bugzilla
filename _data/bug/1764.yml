          while looking at test_tutorial_beamformer20120321.m I noticed that the construction of the singleshell head model is very slow, whereas it is a rather simple one.

          I believe the following is sufficient to reveal the problem

          profile on  load('/home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp/tutorial/beamformer/segmentedmri.mat')
          cfg = [];
          vol = ft_prepare_singleshell(cfg, segmentedmri);
          profile report

          most time is spent in volumethreshold at a simple count of the number of voxels. However, in this case I expect there to be only one compartment, which means that all the complicated stuff in volumeythreshold is not needed.

          it seems to be because it is trying to make a singleshell MEG model out of the sct, grey and white rathen than from the brain.

        thetext: "I added a test that is inspired by test test_tutorial_beamformer20120321 which uses a call to ft_prepare_singleshell without specifying any cfg options. The idea is of course to get a singleshell headmodel based on the brain. This should not take long. If it does, it might be because ft_prepare_mesh is meshing the complex gray, white and csf segmentations rather than the simple brain.\n\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit\nAdding         test/test_bug1764.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 6668.\n\n\nI also made a change to ft_prepare_mesh so that it has reasonable defaults (brain/3000) in case the input is gray/white/csf. I expect this to be useful for localspheres and singlesphere MEG models as well.\n\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit\nSending        ft_prepare_mesh.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 6667\n\n\nFinally I removed the deprecated sourceunits from ft_prepare_singleshell.\n\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit ft_prepare_singleshell.m \nSending        ft_prepare_singleshell.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 6670."
