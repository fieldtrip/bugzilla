          when input is connectivity data that needs cfg.refchannel.

          Reason: ft_checkconfig wants to put cfg.refchannel into cfg.preproc.refchannel. However, functionality in preproc is different (specifying the reference channel for re-referencing) than the expected functionality in the plotting (reference channel for plotting).

          The crash is probably introduced by revision 8138 by Jorn

        thetext: true... hmm... why is that done anyways? It would be more intuitive if the user had to put all preprocessing options in cfg.preproc himself rather than having a function pushing random things there.

          I now circumvented the problem by changing ft_multiplot and ft_singleplot such that only ft_checkconfig is called when it seems reasonable to expect a subfunction to be needed (i.e. when the input data is not frequency domain).
          The reason being that freq2raw (in ft_checkdata) starts whining if the input data does not have rpt in the dimord. (this is in addition to the refchannel problem that initiated this bug).
