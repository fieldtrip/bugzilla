        thetext: "Dear fieldtrip-developers,\nI have been silent for a while, I hope that counts for something :)\n\nAnyway, with the most recent version ft_volumerealign doesn't work for us anymore (thanks to Carol Sanchez for finding this).\nWhat happens is that when reading an mri (tested different types) which results in something like:\n\nmri = \n\n      anatomy: [256x256x256 double]\n          dim: [256 256 256]\n    transform: [4x4 double]\n         unit: 'mm'\n          cfg: [1x1 struct]\n\n\n(here resliced with ft_volumereslice, but that doesn't matter for the error)\n\ncfg=[];\ncfg.method      = 'interactive';\ncfg.coordsys    = 'neuromag';\nmri_aligned    = ft_volumerealign(cfg,mri); \n\ncrashes with the error:\n\nReference to non-existent field 'scalp'.\n\nError in ft_volumerealign>cb_redraw_surface (line\n927)\n  ft_plot_mesh(opt.scalp, 'edgecolor', 'none',\n  'facecolor', 'skin')\n\nError in ft_volumerealign (line 417)\n        cb_redraw_surface(h);\n \n\nthe problem is, as indicated, in the redraw_surface part\n\nwait, I just figured it out: the problem is, that in line 417 it shouldn't be cb_redraw_surface but cb_redraw\n\ncause obviously i want to align a non-segmented mri to fiducials or whatever. \nthen it works.\ncheers\np"

        thetext: "This is related to a recent addition allowing for clicking on surface plots for marking fiducials (r9928, see bug2707).\n\nThe problem being that both in case cfg.viewmode = ortho & surface, cb_redraw_surface(h); is called, which in turn calls plot_mesh with opt.scalp as input. The latter only being available if there is surface data.\n\nAs Philipp indeed suggested, it seems that the line should have been cb_redraw in case of ortho viewmode. \n\nI'll make the change."
