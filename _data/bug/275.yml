          in peerslave.c the killswitch should be triggered if
          either host->timallow is exceeded
          or job->timreq (times a fudge factor) is exceeded.

          i.e. take minimum of the two

          there is currently still a problem with the estimated time of the jobs in peercellfun

          furthermore, 64-bit linux peerslave needs to be recompiled and started on mentat and esi-hpc1
