          The problem was due to data.dimord not being properly parsed. Although there was a piece of code that suggested that it would be used, in fact it did not use it. Consequently, the smart code further down in getdimord was relied upon, and that does not know anything about "subj" or other data fields (such as individual or MIspctrm).

          This commit should fix it.
