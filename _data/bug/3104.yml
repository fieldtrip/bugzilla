          Some of the workshop wiki pages are down in Coimbra (not in Toulouse at least). Ines Violante, a local organizer, just let me know about the issue:

          %----------------------------------
          So, from the list of workshops I can only access these two:
          London -  http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/london
          Guangzhou - http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/guangzhou

          But not any of the others
          http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/coimbra
          http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/kiel
          %----------------------------------

          Does somebody know what could be the issue?

          at this moment all four pages are working fine from Stockholm. I have noticed myself also a few times recently that pages were slow in being updated (i.e. after an edit the old page would still show for some time), but not that they failed. I suspect it to be due to performance problems on the (shared) fcdonders web server. The TG (CC) has been made aware of this multiple times, but has not been able to reproduce or pinpoint the problem.

          The only solution that I can think of is to move away from the fcdonders web server.

          Please let me know if the problem still exists or if it persists.

          Thanks for your quick response Robert.

          @Ines: does the problem still going on?

        thetext: last week at the MEG toolkit in Nijmegen we had a lot of simultaneous users and noticed no speed problems. Hence I'll close the issue. Please reopen if you encounter new or persistent problems
