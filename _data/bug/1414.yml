This is due to comp.grad being the balanced version and containing the pca labels rather than the MEG labels. This is something that I won't fix here and now, so I made a workaround in the test script."

          I traced down test_bug70:

          The first error is due to bem_openmeeg being renamed to openmeeg. I fixed that with a "renamedval" in  ft_prepare_headmodel. I also updated the test script itsellf.

          Sending        test/test_bug70.m
          Transmitting file data ..

          Subsequently it gets stuck in not being able to execute openmeeg. I reopened bug #70 and added a description there.

          I traced down test_qsubcellfun:

          This wa s a silly error, causing fieldtrip/peer to be on the path instead of fieldtrip/qsub. With the correct path it now works fine.

I already fixed those. There was also bem_cp, which I renamed into the original bemcp (and added a renamedval option to ft_prepare_headmodel).\n\nThe second set of problems I ran into is that the input geometry variable into ft_headmodel_xxx has apparently changed. The test script gives them other inputs than what the functions now expect. I have made the forward/ft_headmodel_xxx functions more robust for the input geometry.\n\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit ft_prepare_headmodel.m \nSending        ft_prepare_headmodel.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 5623.\n\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit\nSending        forward/ft_headmodel_concentricspheres.m\nSending        forward/ft_headmodel_localspheres.m\nSending        forward/ft_headmodel_singlesphere.m\nTransmitting file data ...\nCommitted revision 5624.\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit\nSending        forward/ft_headmodel_concentricspheres.m\nSending        forward/ft_headmodel_singlesphere.m\nTransmitting file data ..\nCommitted revision 5625.\n\nThe test script gets quite far, but at a certain moment it gets stuck in the openmeeg volume conduction models.

Probably the cluster is too busy, causing the test script to take too long, causing the parent MATLAB to be killed because not enough time was allocated for it. \n\nTo be discussed with Boris."

          although bug #1426 has been resolved, test_bug70 and test_bug1042 are still failing.

          test_bug1042 now seems to run, i.e. it does not result in an explicit error.
