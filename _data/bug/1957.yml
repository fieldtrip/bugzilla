          removed utilities/mailto, since it duplicates the standard MATLAB sendmail command. The sendmail function works on all platforms, mailto only worked on linux/mentat.

          (In reply to comment #3)

          The previous link gives the ActiveX solution for windows.

          On http://matlab.izmiran.ru/help/techdoc/matlab_env/command4.html I found "On Macintosh platforms, you cannot run AppleScript directly from MATLAB. However, you can run the Macintosh OS X osascript function from the MATLAB unix or ! (bang) function to run AppleScript from MATLAB."

          I think that with applescript it should be possible to tell mail to open a new message with attachment.

          How about linux? Or should we implement our own platform independent MATLAB function that opens a figure with three "edit" gui elements for "to", "subject" and "message" and then pass the user-specified content into sendmail?

        thetext: 'For opening the user''s mail client, how about using the mailto: URL protocol? You can specify stuff like so mailto:robert@example.com?subject=hoi&body=blablabla . On most machines, this should launch the mail client. I don''t know if we can work with attachments through this mechanism though.'

          >> web('mailto:r.oostenveld@example.com')

          works nicely on OS X. However as suggested here http://forums.devshed.com/beginner-programming-16/using-mailto-with-an-attachment-66699.html and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3019547/is-it-possible-to-add-a-attachment-to-a-mail-with-the-mailto-function-in-actions

          >> web('mailto:r.oostenveld@example.com?attachment=file://etc/host')

          does not include the attachment.

          This http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/rfc2368.txt explains that it is not standard.

          One comment in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6029579/start-mail-client-with-attachment/6093765#6093765 suggests to create an EML file (http://www.coolutils.com/Formats/EML). But it also does not seem to work, as it opens the eml file read-only, i.e. not "to send".

          ---

          if we would upload the html, then we can do something like
          >> web('mailto:r.oostenveld@example.com?subject=''cool website''&body=http://tinyurl.com/a68fv32')

          So an option would be
          share  -> 1) upload to web
          share  -> 2) send as email
          with the only difference that 2) would upload and then compose the email, whereas 1 only uploads.

          But how about security? E.g. http://blog.insicdesigns.com/2009/01/secure-file-upload-in-php-web-applications. What if the javascript in the uploaded html were to be malicious?
