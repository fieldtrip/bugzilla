          If a fieldtrip buffer server has been installed in a Matlab session running under windows (winXP), then after exiting Matlab a process keeps running in the background. This causes issues when shutting down the computer or when corresponding Matlab session was automatically launched software-wise.

          It can be simulated by just executing:
          >> ft_create_buffer(1972)

          followed by:
          >> ft_destroy_buffer

          This will make Matlab freeze and it can only be stopped through the Windows Task Manager.

          I just stole this bug from Arjen since Philip asked me about it. I can replicate this bug on Windows 7, but not on Linux (mentat301). Thus, it appears to be platform specific.

          The mex-file that is called from Philips example is $FT/realtime/buffer/matlab/buffer.c.

Apparently, th fist clear statement skips the buffer mex file. \n\nFurther, the buffer function does not seem to be locked ('help mislocked')."

          Please note that without starting a buffer server, clearing the mex does work:

          >> buffer('tcpserver', 'exit');
          >> clear mex;  % no problem

        thetext: Yes, I would still be very happy if this issue could be solved. The issue not only occurs on systems running  windows (Matlab hangs), but also on macs running OSX. Although in the latter case Matlab often (not always) crashes at the moment Matlab shuts down and clears the buffer mex file.

          Do you happen to have a solution/implementation, or suggestion for a fix? Given that we currently do not have the resources to take up this project, I feel inclined to label this bug as a 'wont fix'. Feel free to reopen this bug in case you think otherwise.

          Unfortunately, I do not have any suggestion for a fix. I will only opt for reopening the bug if new insights would make efforts from your side meaningful. Anyway thanks for taken efforts thus far.

          None of the people of the FieldTrip team at the DCCN can afford their time working on this. The only solution that I see is that someone outside the DCCN fixes it.
