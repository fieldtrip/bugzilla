          - simulate data with two dipoles with 'appropriate timecourses'
          - replace timelock- with freqanalysis
          - insert figure "Conventional beamformer source reconstruction fails for correlated sources"
          - insert code "Beamformer source reconstruction with a two-dipole source model"
          - work out "Beaming cortico-muscular coherence with a two-dipole source model"

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
