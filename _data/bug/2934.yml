        thetext: "Ricardo (CC) suggested an improvement on ft_databrowser, which is to keep a number of channels (such as EOG) constantly in view when browsing and paging (in small groups of channels) through 306 channel MEG data. \n\nRight now if you make a channel selection, and then page to the next group of channels (i.e. not horizontal paging but vertical paging), all channels are incremented with a certain amount."

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #0)

          Thank you, Robert, for opening this bug.

          I attach my (nasty) solution to the problem (for fieldtrip-20150219 version). It can for sure be upgraded. It includes the modification of the cfg.channel variable and its restoration. Modified lines end with '%#%' in my code and are around line 1473 and around line 1947.

          This took far too long to resolve, but it has been implemented as of Pull request 299.
          I took the liberty of changing a few small things:

          cfg.physio has been changed into cfg.channelclamped.

          Also, it should be specificied as an array of labels, rather than as a scalar number.

          Thanks for the suggestion!
