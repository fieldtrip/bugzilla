An obvious speed improvement can be achieved by using fftfilt instead of filter. @Andreas: do you see any objection in building in a switch that is either using fftfilt or filter based on some heuristic?'

          Define "prohibitively" ;)

          I would have no objections against building in fftfilt support. However, I would like to avoid changing default behavior for two reasons: filter and fftfilter do not give numerically identical results. This would compromise backward compatibility and replicability, e.g. for re-analysis or comparison to other software packages. And, less critical, with some initial testing I got some quite different results for the critical filter length on different platforms. Not sure whether this is due to OS, or CPU, or library optimization differences. And not sure whether there is really a simple heuristic.

          I would suggest simply using a flag as in the attached example (with a default of 0). If you want to implement a different more complex solution I'm open but I would like to ask for permission to port this solution also to EEGLAB in order to keep the low-level functions in sync.

          Best,
          Andreas

          Hi Andreas,

          I am pretty sure you do not need to ask permission from us to do anything ;)

          (In reply to widmann from comment #3)

          My heuristic would be: switch to fftfilt if it takes longer to filter a single trial than for me to fetch a coffee. (to give an indication: my office is on the second floor, and due to the fact that the building is being renovated at the moment, I need to take the far end staircase, which results in me having to traverse a long corridor twice, because the coffee room is essentially right below my office, but two floors down).......

          Thanks for the patch!

          So for the sake of your health a complete patch attached ;) I hope I didn't miss anything obvious. Do you integrate the patch and close the bug?

          Hi Andreas,
          Apologies, but I did not notice that you contributed a full git-based patch. I am still using svn, so I will need some directions how to incorporate your patch.

          This is a regular patch you should be able to apply with
          patch -p0 < fftfilt4fieldtrip_v2.patch
          if fftfilt4fieldtrip_v2.patch is in the root folder of your fieldtrip installation.

          I just noticed that I forgot to add the documentation for the new usefftfilt option in private/preproc.m. Please use the new v2 version of the patch.

          Best,
          Andreas
