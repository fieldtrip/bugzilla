          How to label electrodes that have no label on the easycap webpage?
          example: http://www.easycap.de/easycap/_img/content/ea_08_M24.gif
          As far as I can see the problem is that some electrodes are freely positional.

          Template GIF vs. FT layout

          While working on this, I realized that there is a mismatch between the FT topo and the one on the homepage. E.g. channel 6 is not on the midline, channel 73 is not on the outer ring of the head, etc... I suppose this is FT related, because there is just no way I can adjust the exact position of the channels. The layout is constructed by taking the relative distance of the sensors to each other.

          I finished layouts for M1, M10, M11, M14, M15 and M16
          M7 is a variation of M14, meaning that I just have to rename or delete some channels
          M1 can be the model template for M3, M17, M19, M20, M22, M23, M24 and M25, see above what this means.

          However, the only question left is, how should I label channels that have an empty label on the webpage?

          the empty circles are placeholders, they are not included in the actual cap, right?

          Could you check the electrode count?

          If needs be, I can provide you with the names (there is a consistent naming scheme that also includes those).

          Please note that ft_layoutplot has the option cfg.image where you can specify the bitmap. Please use that to ensure the correct placement.

          Should we update/improve the tutorial at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/layout?

          This is because of the scaling of the channel positions to fit exactly in the circle, i.e. the initial problem reported by Johanna that caused us to trigger these efforts.

It's just that the formerly unlabeled got a place and\n> name in M20, now. \n\nPlease look up the Oostenveld &Praamstra 2001 paper on electrode nomenclature for extended 10-20 systems. Many of the unlabeled positions in the bitmaps can be labeled based on either the 10-20, the 10-10 or the 10-5 layout.\n\nThe M19 cap at http://www.easycap.de/easycap/e/electrodes/18_M19.htm suggests that it is a 2x64 channel system. So the white circles are no placeholders here, but actual channels. However, the particular layout is \"The graphic shows as an example an arrangement by ... Jena\" not standard. So M19 should not be done. \n\nM25 for example mentions at http://www.easycap.de/easycap/e/electrodes/04_M25.htm that there are 23 electrode positions. The white circles therefore are placeholders but not actually in the cap. \n\n> Should I just exclude the placeholder electrodes, or exclude the whole layout? \n\njust exclude all the fuzzy layouts\n\n>...\n> some weeks ago.

I am afraid that you missed out on a particular FT meeting in which bug #890 was cerated/discussed."
