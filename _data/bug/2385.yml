          Based on a mail from Max Cantor, I realized that we can easily provide 3D elec-files:
          This link on the easycap website (http://www.easycap.de/easycap/e/downloads/how_to_read_3d.htm) explains the coordinate system.

          Conversion to radians has to be done (this is what Max reported):
          X = COS(RADIANS(Phi))*SIN(RADIANS(Theta))
          Y = SIN(RADIANS(Theta))*SIN(RADIANS(Phi))
          Z = =COS(RADIANS(Theta))

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #5)\n\nIt is mainly the added responsibility that comes on our shoulders that I see as a potential problem. I am wary of \"processing\" or \"polishing\" external files and then adding them to FT, as that involves decisions that need to be motivated/justified/documented and then people keep us responsible for all aspects of the file (including the historical versions).\n\nI think that if we add the three files as they are and clearly document where we got them from, it is OK to add them to our release. \n\nThe whole point of the template section (like http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/template/electrode) on the wiki is to make it easier to provide provenance to the \"data files\" that we release. so in this case I actually don't see any issues to release them (copy and paste the EGI story)."

          (In reply to Jim Herring from comment #8)

          Are the file actually correct SFP files?

          SFP is a file format defined by BESA and not invented by us. See http://psyphz.psych.wisc.edu/~greischar/BESA_input/importing_data_into_besa.htm

          Hi Jim,

          nope, I actually renamed the file-extension (and obviously did not test with the new extension). Apparently not a smart move. They were .txt files originally

          Hi Joern and Robert,

          ft_fileformat and ft_read_sens can handle EasyCap text files downloaded from their website just fine (at least now, maybe not when you added the templates). However, the first line has to start with 'Site', which is not the case in the .sfp files but is the case in the .txt files downloaded from the EasyCap website.
