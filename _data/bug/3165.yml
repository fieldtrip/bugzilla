          Since the changes for Octave compatibility (commit a297d505daa7e817a77f3fb6625c16acd84aed68) it is not possible anymore to use integer coordinates. The regexp expects floating numbers.

          And the label must not contain hyphens.

          I am not too familiar with regular expressions, but adding a \- in the channel_label variable (as introduced by Nikolaas) should do the trick.

          Agreed?

          If so, I'll update the master branch on github accordingly.

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #3)

          Thanks Jan-Mathijs and Joscha for reporting this. Indeed it would seem that adding a hyphen through '\-' would add support for labels with hyphens.

          best,
          Nick

          OK, done.

          @Joscha: note that in general we would nowadays recommend using layouts specified in a mat-file, which allows for more flexible outlines (in particular preventing the creation of the in your example layout silly circular head with ears and nose), and masks.
