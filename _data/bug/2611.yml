        thetext: "Dear ft developers,\nwe recently encountered an issue with ft_read_mri on (one of the few) windows machines in our lab. \nThe issue emerges when loading a dicom series. Within load_dicom_series the dicom folder is wrongly captured.\n\nthis is caused by the integrated function getdcmdir (from line 112)\n\nthere the file separator is defined as slash, which does not work for windows. \n\nan easy fix would be to add\n\nfs = filesep;\n\nand replace all '/' by fs\n\ncheers\nphilipp"
