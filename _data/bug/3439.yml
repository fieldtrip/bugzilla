          There's a report that the OpenMEEG test script does not produce the expected results: https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/openmeeg-info/2018/000254.html

          I have confirmed this also happens for me with OpenMEEG v2.3 and 2.4, on Matlab R2016a and Matlab R2018a.

          Thanks Robert. It seems the only relevant test in that directory is test_headmodel_openmeeg.m

          It does produce sensible plots when I run it manually, but it seems the test would only check for a crash of the script rather than erroneous output.

          The test script I was referring to is external/openmeeg/testOpenMEEGeeg.m, which also checks that the output is within a certain tolerance of expected results.

          While the other test functions make some OpenMEEG calls, it seems they likewise would only fail if there's an actual crash. It looks like testOpenMEEGeeg.m may be the only one that tests whether the output yields the expected values, so I think that's a good suggestion to move it so it automatically runs.

          @Alex, as far as I see, this test function exists only locally in FieldTrip? Or do we need to worry about syncing with the OpenMEEG repository? (I ask because it's currently located in external/openmeeg)

          testOpenMEEGeeg.m was written before the testing system of fieldtrip was setup AFAIK.
          we already test the C++ openmeeg code in our repo. testOpenMEEGeeg.m tests the FieldTrip integration. I think the test should be run with OpenMEEG release version.

        thetext: I think @Robert would have to help with implementing testing with different OpenMEEG versions, since the automated tests run on a Donders server that probably has only a single version (2.2?) currently installed.

          All should be resolved with:
          https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/747

          Please reopen and comment in case of problems. Should work with OpenMEEG 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.
