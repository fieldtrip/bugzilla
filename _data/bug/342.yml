        thetext: furthermore, the list of types has to be cleaned up and similar types should be merged. We should make a list of all types used throughout fieldtrip and they should be made consistent (e.g. localspheres instead of multisphere, and consistent use of bem).

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
