          Related to the point you mentioned about new visualization tool, ft_sourceplot seems to open a new window, right? I've been using subplot to compare source plots on mesh between conditions, which doesn't work anymore.

          It might be a good idea to include an option not to creat a new figure.

        thetext: "at line 638 in sourceplot it does\n\n%% start building the figure\nh = figure;\nset(h, 'color', [1 1 1]);\nset(h, 'visible', 'on');\nset(h, 'renderer', cfg.renderer);\ntitle(cfg.title);\n\nThis indeed has the consequence that the function cannot be used in subplots.\n\nBased on experience I would not be able to tell which function will open a new figure, which will use the present figure (or subfigure) and which one will use the present figure after clearing it.\n\n Looking at other functions, I see that \n * ft_topoplotCC has the option cfg.newfigure=yes/no. \n * ft_multiplotER seems to reuse the current figure\n * ft_databrowser always creates a new figure\n * ...\n\nSo it is inconsistent. Perhaps the cfg.newfigure option could be used throughout. \n\nThere are some functions that use the subplot command:\n\nmac001> grep subplot *.m | grep -v ':%'\n(too long to list here)\n\nThe use of subplot probably requires that the existing figure gets cleared, i.e. outside the ft functino the user would not be allowed to use subplots. In sourceplot that applies to orto, but not the other plotting methods."

        thetext: "yes, this has actually been fixed some time ago. \n\nFor rereferce, there is now the cfg.figure option for all plotting functions, which is handled in fieldtrip/private/open_figure.m \n\nYou can specify a new figure, an existing figure that needs to be cleared, or an existing function tha should not be cleared. \n\nAlso the figure name (in the window), title (above the axes), position, renderer and visibility are centrally managed here. \n\nSee https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/private/open_figure.m"
