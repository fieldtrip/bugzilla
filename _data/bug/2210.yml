          Created attachment 490
          EGI file to read

          Hi,

          I have a problem reading an EGI .raw file, acquired in May 2010 (I attached it to this bug).

          Code:
          cfg.dataset = 'svui_0003_eeg_go-sd_001.raw';
          ft_preprocessing(cfg)

          This is due to this commit:
          https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/9ffae75ee29f3ae31451e7590e470d8239a6e08b

          The header of my file is:
          hdr.orig.header_array: [4 2010 5 6 10 7 57 520 1000 257 1 0 0 0 1 2221 9]
          The last two logical operators evaluate to FALSE, while it should be TRUE to make it read the data correctly.

          Can you check whether you can fix the logical conditions so that it returns TRUE for this file?

          Thanks!

          Gio
