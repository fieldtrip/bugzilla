          the getglobal function is called many times without the global variables changing. Having persistent variables previous_argin and previous_argout would speed it up.

          See peer/private/getcustompath or getcustompwd

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
