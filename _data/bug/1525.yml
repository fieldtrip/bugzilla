          When I used biosemi2ft.exe to collect data, I found the sample number of event is different from that of data sometimes.
          Now I found that it happens when you do not have enough data to send to buffer, i.e. when your down sample number is high.
          I read through the source code and found that the value 'numThisTime' in 'handleStreaming' function of 'OnlineDataManager.h' becomes zero in that case.
          However, you call 'clientrequest' function anyway, so the sample number of data becomes bigger than that of event.

          I think all I have to do is just changing the code to check the vale 'numThisTime' and do not call 'clientrequest' function if it is zero.

          Please let me know if this works.


          Thank you in advance.

          Dear Wataru Yasuda,

          Thank you for your suggestion. I quickly glanced over the fragment in OnlineDataManger, and see what you mean.

          The fix sound straight forward indeed, but before I proceed I like to have a more complete overview.

          Could you perhaps elaborate on what you mean with the sample number of the event and the sample number of the data? I can think of several interpretations ( especially due to downsampling and client/server views).

          Thanks,

          Boris

          Dear Wataru,

          Thank you for your elaboration, it is very helpful. My understanding is that:

          - 'ft_read_header' returns the nsamples from buffer,
          - 'ft_read_event' returns events that contain a sample number.

          How often do you send an event (trigger)? Could it be the case that 'event_time' contains the sample number of your last trigger, and that 'endptr' contains the sample number of the last EEG sample? This would explain the increasing difference between the two numbers.

          Best,

          Boris

          Dear Boris,

          I understood your comment, however, the frequency of a trigger doesn't make any change for this problem.
          In my case, the trigger occurs approximately once a second.
          Still the difference increases continuously.

          The point is that the difference increases continuously.
          And when I set 'downsample' value of configuration file to 8 from 4, the increasing ratio increased.
          I noticed that it was equivalent to the rate of occurrence that numThisTime becomes zero.

          So I tried to fix it by writing just one line below in handleStreaming().

           if(numThisTime == 0) return true;

          I wrote it just before the line below in handleStreaming().

           err = clientrequest(ftSocket, sampleBlock->asRequest(), resp.in());

          Then, I checked the data and found the difference dissapeared.
          I am not sure if this doesn't bother other functions.
          So it would be appreciated if you could help me.


          Thanks,
          Wataru Yasuda

          Some extra info: If 'numThisTime == 0', then the call sampleBlock->getMatrix on line 613 in [1] returns a NULL pointer, see [2]. So, this would mean that besides the sample problem, *data is also written to uninitialized memory*. C++ has undefined behaviour in this case --- thus the program might continue to run without a sign.

          This NULL pointer suggests that the call to clientrequest in 644 of [1] would contain a NULL pointer as well, but instead, *the old content of FtSampleBlock* is used, and sent to the buffer. Indeed, too many samples are copied to the FieldTrip buffer.

          Dear Boris,

          I am very happy to see that you have found the mechanism of the problem.

          Actually, 'skipSamples' of line 634 doesn't become 0 when 'numThisTime' is 0.
          That is why this program did not crash even 'dest' of line 613 was NULL pointer, I think.

          Dear Wataru,

          We just finished reorganizing the realtime dir, and we would like to announce this on the FieldTrip mailing list. It would be very nice if we could fix this bug before this announcement.

          Could you give an indication when you would be able to test if our fix indeed fixes this bug? That would allow us to coordinate the changes and announcements.

          Best regards,
