          Created attachment 241
          new directory tree.

          Robert and Boris agreed on a directory structure for the realtime directory. The main changes:
          - one directory per platform with executables
          - libraries needed to compile binaries are centralized
          - generally more pleasant layout :).

          The new directory layout is presented in the attached file.

        thetext: Various compilers have been used to create the binaries in the SVN repo. It would be useful to identify the associated dependencies (dynamic link libraries). Ideally, we would work towards a situation a well supported compiler is used together with a single Makefile.

          It seems that all the windows executables in revision 5601 are created with mingw32, since the word mingw is used at least once in the binaries:

            $ for f in `find . -name "*.exe"`; do echo $f; strings $f | grep -i mingw | sort | uniq | wc; done
            <snip>

          Inspection of a few matches reinforces this suspicion.
