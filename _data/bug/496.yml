          once upon a time there was an idea to also use the buffer for communicating sticky events, i.e. events that would not be counted by sample number but rather general properties (i.e. "start acquisition" and "sampling rate = 1200")

          It never fully materialized. The snippets of code that pertain to this should be better removed.
