          In ft_singleplotER, lines 261-322, when using it with multiple datasets, the mask box of the second data occludes the data line of the first dataset.

          In ft_plot_vector, line 193, there is a comment that the data lines need to be plotted again to place them over the box instead of under. This works fine for one dataset, but to plot multiple datasets, the ft_plot_vector functions is called multiple times, which means it draws a new box for the second dataset which occludes the previously drawn lines and boxes.

          Hi Jeroen,

          I am just in the process of making substantial changes to ft_singleplotER, to improve its future maintenance. I will address this issue in the process and keep you posted

          Hi Jeroen, I made a tentative fix in ft_singleplotER (apart from the major changes in code structure). I just committed the code. It is availabel at google-code right now, and otherwise as of tonight on the ftp-server. Could you check whether it works for you?

          Thanks,

          Jan-Mathijs

          Hi Jan-Matthijs,

          I have tested the new version with my data and no lines are occluded anymore.
          Thanks!

          Jeroen.
