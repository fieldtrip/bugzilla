          I downloaded fieldtrip-20101122 and tried to do realtime stuff on the London CTF MEG system.

          >> ft_realtime_signalviewer(cfg)
          processing segment 1 from sample 72127 to 72726
          ??? Undefined command/function 'offset2time'.

          Error in ==> ft_realtime_signalviewer at 140
              data.time{1}  = offset2time(begsample, hdr.Fs, endsample-begsample+1);

          I suspect this to be due to recent ft-prefixing. The realtime module should be made more independent of the rest.

        thetext: Offset2time has now become a subfunction of all of the realtime functions that were depending on it (incl. signalviewer). In order to clean up the realtime directory, offset2time will now be removed from the /realtime/utlities directory.
