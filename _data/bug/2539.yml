          Whenever I use ft_topoplotIC fieldtrip performs a check on the data and checks if the .time field is present. I never save this, because I only need to save the mixing, unmixing and topolabel fields for the rest of my anlyses. Saving all the trial data and the time fields only takes unnecesary disk space. The bug is easy to 'fix' by introducing a fake .time field, but it would be cleaner if the ft_topolotIC only checks for the precense of the mixing weights and the topolabels. More is not needed for plotting the IC topographies.

        thetext: "fair point. We discussed this actually 2 weeks ago in our FT meeting. See http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/meeting/20140402\n\nHere are the relevant notes. \n\nsupport for component data in source reconstruction functions:\n1. dipolefitting and mne should in principle be doable.\n2. yet, the functions may become confused because of the mixed representation of the component data (in a freq/tlck structure).\n3. identify which functions should support this, but currently don't do it well.\n4. ensure that the data is unambiguous, i.e. only keep topo/topolabel and remove anything else.\n\nMore general: whenever a function needs only the component topographies, it should remove the other fields as soon as possible. \n\nThis is followed up in detail in bug 2518.\n\nHowever, I think that the changes I implemented for bug 2518 might have caused an error to slip in, since datatype=comp in the past always meant raw-comp, whereas it now can also be timelock-comp or freq-comp. The error below suggests that the code expects raw-comp, but that the data is different. \n\nCan you share the data and the cfg you are using?"

          ICA mixing and unmixing weights for one subject

          Attached are the mixing and unmixing weights for a single subject. They were computed more than two weeks ago, so before the fieldtrip meeting. I ran another ICA today with Floris de Vries and encountered what I think are some other unnesecary dependencies if you run it now. I can look into that tomorrow. Ik commented out the adding of the weigths.time field that 'solves' the problem.

          %weights.time{1}=nan;

          sz=size(weights.topo);

          cfg=[];
          cfg.component          = 1:16;
          cfg.layout             = '/home/language/rensch/layers/data/EEG/scripts/MR64.lay';
          cfg.zlim               = 'maxabs';
          cfg.marker             = 'on';

          figure(11);ft_topoplotIC(cfg, weights);
