          Hi John,

          We intend to deprecate ft_headmodelplot, because we think that most functionality of this function is covered by other (and newer) (and less ugly) plotting functions. Those are in fieldtrip/plotting, e.g. ft_plot_sens, and ft_plot_vol.

          This would mean that we will most likely remove this function altogether. Could you live with that?

          @Robert: moving to the compat-directory is not straightforward due to the function's dependencies. There are quite a few private functions on which ft_headmodelplot depends, which themselves also rely on private functions etc. First I thought just to include the relevant private code as subfunctions, but it will be quite a lot. Would you agree not to svn move it as it is, but to really deprecate it (and throw an error if it is called?)

Please look at this FAQ (insert wiki page) for the suggested alternative approach. If you still want to use this function and get errors like ... (insert the first dependency error that they would get), you can manually move this function from its present location into the fieldtrip main directory, where it still may work')\n\nIt is a long warning, but should get the message across. A key ingredient is the FAQ that should explain how to plot the different geometrical objects that are involved in source modeling."
