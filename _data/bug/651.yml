          In ft_sourcestatistics (line 286) and statistics_wrapper (line 248): data.design may also exist.  Should user put design in cfg or data, or either ok?  (If put in both, make sure it is same design, or let one override?)

          More needed on wiki or in help-comments of two fcns above, than just http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/source_statistics
          for how to create a design matrix (i.e. what does this matrix mean, depending on what stats you are doing).  Create FAQ for this? 'how to create a design matrix?'

          Is it always a 1xN vector assigning a condition to a trial, or can it be MxN where M are different ways of describing trials (e.g. left/right response, correct/incorrect response, cue probability, etc )? If so, how does one choose which are factors-of-interest and factors-of-no-interest?

          Note to self:
          currently called by::
          grep 'prepare_design' *.m ./*/*.m ./*/*/*.m ./*/*/*/*.m -l
          ft_sourcestatistics.m (called on absence of cfg.design)
          ./private/statistics_wrapper.m (called on absence of cfg.design)

          Replace these by an error stating that the cfg.design should be specified, with a short reference to the FAQ on the wiki.

          The information on the design matrix is a bit scattered throughout the documentation. It is for example mentioned in the doc of freqstatistics, but not in timelockstatistics or sourcestatistics. There is a good description in the tutorials for event-related and tfr data, but not for source data? There is a good faq on it, but from the name it looks like it only pertains to random permutations, while ft_statistics_analytic also needs it.

          How specific is it for all the stat-functions and data-types? Is the definition generic enough to simply put it in one location? Or do we make a FAQ for every stat/data-type?
