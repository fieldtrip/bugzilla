        thetext: Yet, within the code the cfg.layout is converted into a cfg.template (i.e. converted into a string with .mat) and then the respective mat-file is loaded. This only works if the template actually exists. Yet, the help of the function and the presence of the cfg option layout suggest that it works with cfg.layout as well.

        thetext: "The help does not point that 'feature' explicitly out, because I still need to do very many templates... I should probably get starting with that next week. The help just states \"The positions of the channel are specified in a gradiometer or electrode configuration or from a layout.\". \n\nI would suggest to keep it as an undocumented feature for now - if people are using 'template' with any other recording system than EEG or CTF-MEG, they will get an error that there is no appropriate template anyways."

          Hey JM,
          can you reformulate again what your concern is? I am nearly finished with computing templates for all layouts we have available, would that solve this issue?

        thetext: If I recall correctly, the user-specified XXX.lay is transformed into XXX.mat internally. This would still crash if a user specifies a custom layout for which no template is available.
