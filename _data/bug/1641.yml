          Make the magic happen.

          Regular scrolling: horizontal axis zoom in (up) and zoom out (down)
           Ctrl + scrolling: vertical axis zoom in (up) and zoom out (down)

        thetext: great idea!  but I would place a vote for vertical scrolling by default and ctrl+scroll for horizontal.  but maybe i'm just backwards.

          Yep, I'm working on such an overview. Expect it done either tomorrow or Monday :)

          As for the mouse wheel thing, I would vote for regular scrolling to actually result in scrolling the data (so no zooming there), whereas Ctrl+scrolling would result in zooming vertically. Then Ctrl+Shift+scrolling could result in horizontal zooming. This would also be consistent with what I'm pretty sure is the common/expected behaviour for zooming with keys, i.e., Ctrl++/- would be vertical zoom, Ctrl+Shift++/- horizontal zoom. But I'm still working on a definitive answer to these of course.

        thetext: "Hmmm, interesting. On my browser (chrome) btw, ctrl+shift scrolling is the same as ctrl+scrolling. \n\nRegular data-scrolling I'm gonna look at in bug 1642, if it is feasible to scroll/drag/whatever little bits at a time in a fluent way. If not, I don't think we should hook such a thing to scrolling/dragging."
