        thetext: "Hi Yuval,\n\nThanks for reporting this.\n\nIndeed, \n\nwindow(@triang, 500, []) fails. I wonder in which case the function call would actually work...\n\n@Roemer: could you have a look at this, and fix it? In generall, if the documentation suggests support for windowing functions (which themselves are supported by the window function) it should be supported. Could you also fix this for specest_mtmfft and anywhere it is needed?"

          Bug should be fixed now, and triang can be used again.
          Thanks again for reporting,
