        thetext: "Hi,\n\nI would like to perform sourcestatistics on my beamforming source-reconstruction.\nI am looking at:\n- the example script about sourestatistics\n http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/source_statistics\nand it is not clear how the grandaverages that I use in the grouplevel statistics are created.\n\nIt is not clear because the help of ft_sourcegrandaverage does not contain any information about what kind of parameter or data I have to use when I want to use the grandaverage for sourcestatistics with method: 'montecarlo'. Only methods: 'parametric', 'randomization'  and 'randcluster' are mentioned. \nMoreover, I \"naivly\" would do the following:\n\nI would create two grandaverages (for condition 1 and 2) based on the subject data with cfg.keepindividual='yes', but then I get an output that contains:\naverage.trial: 1X N (number of subject) that is confusing because I wanted to create subject-averages and not trial-averages. But probably, they are the same, and only the naming of the field (trial) confuses me? \n\nIf someone would explain to me all options and outputs and how they will be inputs to sourcestatistics I could improve the example script or I could write up a tutorial.\n\nLilla"

          deprecate keepindividuals in sourcegrandaverage? yes

          should appendsource do the above (concatenation of subjects)? yes

          idem for freq and timelockgrandaverage

          plan:

          -ensure that the append_xxx functions have the required functionality

          -deprecate the keepindividual option, showing a clear error message

          -promote the use of cell-arrays

        thetext: I updated the example script. This change fixes the issue addressed in the title of the bug. Therefore I close it here. The issue regarding ft_appendsource and the deprecation of ft_sourcegrandaverage with cfg.keepindividual should go into another bug.
