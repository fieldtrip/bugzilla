          Created attachment 640
          demonstation script for bug.

          if I supply an mri to ft_volumesegment, that has a mri.unit of 'cm' the resulting seg object erroneously has 'mm' as its units.

          i've tested this with the attached script. and I find that both segmetations have the same brain masks and units however the transforms are different.

          Hi Luke,

          thanks for reporting. I know that SPM (which we use here underneath) assumes/requires the MRI to be in mm, which probably relates to the bug. We'll look at it.

          Robert

        thetext: Sorry it took so long to get back to you. The current version of the code seems to work well, i.e. the units are consistent with the transform fields.

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #2)

          I have recently (~1 month ago) been looking at the units of the input and output of ft_volumesegment (not aware of this bug) and at that moment I confirmed that it was correct.
