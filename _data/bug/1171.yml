          I think the base64.c / base64.h files have been removed from Fieldtrip a long time ago - before the Subversion history. I grep'ed through the C files in Fieldtrip and was unable to find any occurrence of "base64".

          I think the original C source code had been replaced by pure Matlab code a long time ago:
          	external/gifti/@gifti/private/base64decode.m
          	external/gifti/@gifti/private/base64encode.m
          the above pure Matlab code has obviously been taken from Guillaume Flandin's site:
          	http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/gifti/
          which in turn uses code from:
          	http://home.online.no/~pjacklam/matlab/software/util/datautil/

          There has been some recent work on mex files (see bug #1258). In this light, I
          asked at the weekly FT meeting what still needs to be done for documenting /
          cleaning the mex files:

          - Some mex files have a .m file with auto compile instructions. These should be
          removed, and replaced with scripts that present a meaningful error ("... not
          supported on platform ...").
          - All mex files should have a corresponding .m files with help and above error
          message.
          - Check wiki and READMEs as stated by Robert.
          - The guidelines for win32/win64 are clear. Similar guidelines need to be
          created for Linux and OSX.

It would be nice to use this form of auto compilation as much as possible (but not when it is to too difficult, e.g. with the buffer). When compilation fails, and error message with the platform should be printed for future bug reports.'
