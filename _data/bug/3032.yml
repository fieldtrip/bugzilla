          This is a feature request rather than a bug report, so I hope this is the right place to put it, and that Severity = Enhancement was the right way to indicate that.

          I use the summary mode ft_rejectvisual GUI to choose channels to invalidate by first hiding trials that contain artifacts across all channels, then rejecting the channels that still have unusually high kurtosis, for example.  After that, I restore all the trials I've rejected, since I prefer to use partial trial rejection (pulling short clips of time out of my long trials) with various calls to ft_artifact_zvalue.  I end up wasting a lot of time typing in each trial number to toggle them back on, especially since ranges (e.g., 1:10) don't even work.  A "restore all" button would be greatly appreciated!

          Thanks,
          Teresa

        thetext: alternatively, one could consider a channel selection utility as in ft_databrowser.

          would you mind investigating whether the callback function for channel selection in ft_databrowser can be re-used in ft_rejectvisual.

          I am afraid that it would be more than just a copy-paste.

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
