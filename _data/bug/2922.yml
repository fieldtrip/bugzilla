          as detected in Barcelona...

          probably isrow is also missing. I don't know from which version on the function exists.

E.g. if is column were added in 2010b, I suggest to put it in\n\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2010b\n\nand ft_defaults would have to be updated.\n\nWe could have \nfieldtrip/compat/octave\nand\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2010a\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2010b\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2011a\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2011b\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2012a\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2012b\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2013a\nfieldtrip/compat/pre2013b\netc."

I would use something like \n\nif ~exist('isrow', 'builtin')\naddpath(...)\n\nthat would remove the necessity to do a check by matlabversion"

          According to http://www.dynare.org/DynareWiki/MatlabVersionsCompatibility
          isrow/iscolumn/ismatrix was added in 2010b.

          As 2010a is more than 5 years old (5 March 2010), we do not officially support it anymore, however, I do like the idea of having compat folders for the different versions we are still supporting :p

          (In reply to Jörn M. Horschig from comment #2)
          just thought about my suggestion, and I think it's a stupid idea. organizing it by matlab version will be much cleaner and easier to maintain
