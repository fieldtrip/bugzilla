          Just to ensure that the following is clear: ft_plot_headshape has to do with ft_read_headshape, not with the private/headsurface or private/head_surf functions.

          The ft_read_headshape function has been getting more responsibilities over time, initially it just returned a set of points, then also the fiducials (in some cases) where the fiducials can be in MRI coords as opposed to head coords (hence the warp_apply). Then we also started using it for cortical sheets (for Lilla's MNE/FreeSurfer pipeline)

          It is indeed not clear whether the "headshape" should be considered a principal building block.

          Is the function being called from somewhere?

          @Vladimir: are you using the ft_plot_xxx functions in SPM?

          Does not seem to be relevant anymore (as per my previous comment), since Stephen has not followed up on this one for a few years.
          Changing status for this reason.
