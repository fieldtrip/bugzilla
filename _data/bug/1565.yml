          Created attachment 287
          new implementation

          it should not immediately assume the tree structure, but rather express the dependencies. This makes it compatible in style with psom.

          See attached new setup

          ah, there you are. I have been searching for you for well over 30 minutes.
          bad boy!
          don't upload yourself on bugzilla and get lost on my laptop the next time.

          (In reply to comment #1)

          The attachment turned out to be the old version, not the new version that I once made (insprired by PSOM). So I reimplemented the function and named the new version ft_analysispipeline. At the moment they coexist.

          See http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=r7207

          Eelke and I have discussed in the past whether we should set up a "pipeline sharing" service on fieldtriptoolbox.org, but considered it to be too hard to get implemented properly.

          However, we might consider exporting it to http://figshare.com

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #6)\n\nanother one I just looked at is http://datadryad.org. It seems to be more aimed at data, and not more than 10GB. Furthermore, it seems to always relate the \"uploaded data\" to a peer-reviewed publication. \n \nRegarding software it states in the faq \n\n\"While Dryad can host software scripts and snapshots of software source code, we recommend the use of a public software repository with version control for the ongoing maintenance of software packages. Software in Dryad must be released under a CC0 license.\"\n\nSo GPLed software does not meet the requirements."
