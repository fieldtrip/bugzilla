          I am trying to reject some components using ft_rejectcomponent, and even when I "clear nargin" before executing ft_rejectcomponent(cfg,ica,meg) -the respective structures- I receive this error message:

          Error: File: ft_rejectcomponent.m Line: 83 Column: 1
          "nargin" previously appeared to be used as a function or command,
          conflicting with its use here as the name of a variable.
          A possible cause of this error is that you forgot to initialize the
          variable, or you have initialized it implicitly using load or eval.

          I believe this is a bug on fieldtrip's side? If I am mistaken I apologize.

          Best,

          Maarten

          Hi Maarten,

          This morning I made some changes related to bug #3075 that affected "nargin" and therefore suspiciously close in time...

          Looking at the code, I think that my change (not a bug in itself) only revealed a obscure coding pattern that is ft_rejectvisual which is deprecated by MATLAB. Probably the old code was not causing this to be flagged as error yet.

          line 82:

          % the data can be passed as input arguments or can be read from disk
          nargin = 1;
          nargin = nargin + exist('comp', 'var');
          nargin = nargin + exist('data', 'var');


          Which MATLAB version are you using (so that I can try to reproduce?

          The ones that I did not consistently deal with yet are the plotting functions (all f them) that use the variable name in the title of the figure. These are not consistent at the moment, and some use cfg.dataname, whereas others don't.

          doh, the grepped files are not the ones that have changed...

          It seems that ft_selectdata returns different data.cfg in 2014b and 2015b, probably due to some preamble/postamble stuff.

          @Maarten, all problems with nargin seem to have been resolved. Matlab 2016a and especially 2016b (see bug 3138) are very strict and therefore the code needed to be cleaned up anyway.

          @Jan-Mathijs, are there still things to discuss in person? If so, let's meet in person (over a cup of coffee or so).

          can we do an 'or so'? :o)

          I don't have a good recollection of what exactly went wrong when I wrote my earlier comments. I suggest to leave it at this with respect to this bug, and keep eyes and ears open for matlab2015b (which I really should start using).

          I suspect this to be due to another commit that I did this afternoon.

          does the problem persist if you close matlab and start it again? I suspect it to be due to a change in one function, and that MATLAB keeps another related function in memory without updating it, although the code should be "recompiled" as well.

          Please follow up and report at http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3145
