        thetext: This caused all data to be shifted by 1 sample. The impact is minimal, but it is there. How should I go about implementing the fix for this bug? Data analyzed in the pre- and post-fix will differ slightly. The bug could sit here for eternity, as it's only a shift of 1 sample....

        thetext: On second thought, it should. If it doesn't it will try to select the first time-bin (even though in the end it won't because of the time-window) with sample number 0. And the last one will be selected with sample number N-1. This is incorrect, and it was so in the past in freqanalys_wltconvol.
