        thetext: "Irina already notified Marcel of this issue, but just doucmenting it here also. \n\nIrina please add/modify:  A girl at the Krakow toolkit on Windows (7?) using Matlab 2010b added-with-subfolders,or addpath(genpath()), the dml external path, but the +dml folder could not be added.  Marcel has emailed Irina to send this Krakow participant a work-around of path renaming, so perhaps this info should be added to wiki under 'faq'?  \nOr any idea how this can be fixed in general, or trace it to the specific Matlab version (or OS) to warn users?"

        thetext: I propose Irina tests this on a windows 7 machine. No clue what went wrong there. The workaround is not advised since it requires the removal of dml. in every .m file in the DMLT folder...
