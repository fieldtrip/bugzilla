        thetext: "running some statistics I came across the warning:\n\n\"the p-value confidence interval of positive cluster #13 includes 0.050 - consider increasing the number of permutations\"\n\nConsidering the fact that we should base our inferential decision on the position of the largest observed cluster within the randomization distribution, it is a bit silly to make this recommendation for any cluster that is not the largest one. \n\nIt relates to the fact that people still tend to make intepretations of their data, based on the p-values associated with individual clusters, which is strictly speaking a bit silly.\n\nShould we consider only returning this warning for the clusters designated as \"#1\"?"

          People will have stupid ideas anyway, regardless of all our attempts.

          But I also agree.

          hehe, let me rephrase:
          yes, good idea. That might reduce the likelihood of people getting stupid ideas :)
