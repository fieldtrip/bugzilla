        thetext: "> Hi John,\n> \n> Well, first of all your axes *are* not linear. You can clearly see it if\n> you plot e.g. plot(sub03freq_pitch{1}.time) or\n> plot(sub03freq_pitch{2}.freq). If you replace your time/freq axis with\n> something linear (e.g. [1:66], or 1:14 respectively - multiply with\n> samplerate etc. to get a true one) it does work. I will bring it to the\n> development group later this week since i wonder why it shouldn't work\n> with nonlinear axis.\n> \n> Perhaps the way you use the wavelets is not optimal. Given the timewindow\n> you have (1.3 seconds) there are only certain frequencies you can estimate\n> exactly. Now these are not integers. Perhaps some padding will help (to\n> 1.5 seconds e.g.). There are also plenty of nan's because of the\n> timewindow you use. see attachement.\n> \n> Considering the time axis - i dont think your samplerate permits the small\n> timesteps and therefor runs into rounding issues making it nonlinear. That\n> might be your main problem.\n> \n> hope this helps,\n> Stephen\n> \n> script used to make figure:\n> \n> sub03freq_pitch{1}.time = [1:1:66];\n> sub03freq_pitch{1}.freq = [1:1:17];\n> ft_singleplotTFR([],sub03freq_pitch{1});\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>> Hi Stephen,\n>> \n>> I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, and I very much appreciate\n>> the offer to help.
