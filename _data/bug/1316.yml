          line 188 in private/clusterstat.m is

              if length(cfg.dim) == 3 % if source data (3D)
                ft_hastoolbox('spm8',1);
                [posclusobs, posnum] = spm_bwlabel(tmp, 6); % use spm_bwlabel for source data to avoid usage of image toolbox
              else
                posclusobs = bwlabeln(tmp, conndef(length(cfg.dim),'min')); % spm_bwlabel yet (feb 2011) supports only up to 3-D data
              end

          So in case dim==3 it uses spm, and in case 2 it uses the imageproc toolbox. However the comment suggests that spm can also be used for dim==1 and dim==2.

          This should be checked. The actual case might not happen very often, but it is better to make the code robust. Perhaps a test would be to make a 2-d sheet with xgrid=-10:10, ygrid=-10:10 anbd zgrid=40;

          There is also old code hanging around that is never reached. That should be removed.

        thetext: Fixed in revision 5263. Note that spm_bwlabel actually does *not* support 1D data, contrary to what I said earlier. 2D/3D is fine.
