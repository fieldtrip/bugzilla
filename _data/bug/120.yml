          I was testing minimumnormestimate.m

          It was extremely slow with many dipoles, very simple preallocation speeds function up really a lot. Just add:

          dipout.pow = nan( size(dipout.mom,2), size(dat,2));

          before:

          % for convenience also compute power at each location
          for i=dip.inside
            dipout.pow(i,:) = sum(dipout.mom{i}.^2, 1);
          end
          dipout.pow(dip.outside,:) = nan;


          Please, double-check if the dimensions are correct.
