          This was discussed over email with Giorgos.

          I did not check all of them, but some are failing to make a brain mask on the fly (which was indeed code that was affected by my change).

          I suspect that the issue is completely explained by the new code (as of yesterday) not working only on segmentation/parcellation, but also on other fields (such as dim, cfg). I now remove these fields prior to doing the checks on the segmentation/parcellation.

          Committed revision 9916.

          I will postpone recompilation until I see the regression test results on the dashboard.
