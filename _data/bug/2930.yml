        thetext: "I have noticed that in recent matlab versions some plotting functions do not behave as expected. For example, in plotting source data on top of anatomical data using ft_sourceplot (cfg.viewmode = 'ortho') the functional data is not plotted on all subplots. \n\nThis issue could have to do with the change in graphics handling from Matlab2014a onwards. To inventorize where issues occur I will run the plotting test scripts on Matlab 2012b and Matlab 2015a and compare the output figures. \n\nThis bug might depend on bug 2461 but it is not clear yet whether the difference in handling graphics is the only cause."

          So far it seems only ft_sourceplot in ortho viewmode does not plot functional data on top of anatomical data. But perhaps there might be issues with masks in other functions as well. test_ft_topoplotER does not test for plotting masks so I will add that.

        thetext: ft_topoplotER seems to plot highlighted channels quite fine. Problem seems to be restricted to ft_sourceplot. Let's see.
