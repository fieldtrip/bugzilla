          When I run qsubcellfun with a function that loads and saves data it sometimes does not report back to Matlab to tell that job is done. I can see on qstat and from the saved files that the function is done but Matlab doesn't get told about this. This bug does not always occur and when it does one can simply press control c to circumvent it.

          Hi Richard

          I don't think this is an error in qsubcellfun itself, but rather an error in torque not updating the status of the job. I am not able to reproduce or come up with an explanation(*), and hence cannot think of a colution. If it persists, please let me know again.

          *) except this: It might be due to qsublist loosing its persistent variable, thereby not being able to track the jobs any more. That is not meant to happen and I don't know how to prevent it.
