        thetext: At present there is some code in fieldtrip that can deal with the NIRS machine from BUCN; this is a very similar machine, but the file format that it can read (basically ASCII with some assumed structure) contains data that has already been processed to some extent (converted into oxy and deoxy signals). The conversion ideally can be done by the reading routine directly.

        thetext: Just spoke to Alex. She pointed me to Homer, and said that the toolbox has improved substantially since she and I last looked at it. She further advised to use this rather than implement things from scratch. What's your feeling Janny? I still don't mind having a shot at it, but I also think that we should not re-invent the wheel.

        thetext: Why is there a sqrt in line 46 of process_raw_data_16Dfrontal_INCY.m ? Janny, could you find out whether this is still needed?

          @Janny: can you send me the following function: oxy_and_deoxy_deltaC770?

          Thanks,

        thetext: Hoi Janny, kun je mij een schema sturen met de layout van de sources en detectoren, zoals jullie die gebruiken op het DCC? Dit in verband met de afstanden tussen sources en detectors en het gevolg van deze afstand voor de signaalverwerking. Dank.

        thetext: Hoi Janny, I haven't heard of you for a while. Is this here still an issue, or has it been put on hold? If it's not intended to follow up on this any time soon, my suggestion would be to close this bug for the time being.
