          Trying to read Yokogawa 64

          >> grad = ft_read_sens('2009_10_30_0209_ME039_B1.con');
          Warning: could be Yokogawa system
          > In fileio\private\ft_senstype at 233
            In ft_read_sens at 233


          Hi, thanks for your efforts on supporting the Yokogawa format. We have a Yokogawa 64 channel paediatric system along with the meg160. I wonder if I supplied some data for this system if it could be integrated into the read routines. The header is essentially the same but currently the routines throw up warnings due to it not being included in ft_read_sens. Thanks, Paul

          Hi Paul,

          At present the Yokogawa MEG input in FT is in a state of
          transition as Yokogawa has released an official input toolbox.
          The integration of the new toolbox will take about 2-3 weeks
          and the result will be anounced. We will try to recognize all
          Yokogawa systems in ft_senstype, but this is not easy as
          the Yokogawa design is very flexible and almost all systems
          are slightly different. For most purposes you can ignore
          the warnings.

          To test the current routines with Sydney data please use
          the attached script, which refers already to some data
          from Sydney (via Doug).

          If you want to have correct gain for your data before the transition
          is accomplished, then do the following change to bypass a bug
          in the old Yokogawa routines (change gain to match your
          recording condition):

          read_yokogawa_header.m:
          ...
          66 % amp_gain        = GetMeg160AmpGainM(fid);
          67 amp_gain = 500
          ...


          Yours, Till

          For people using downloaded zip-archives of FieldTrip please
          bear in mind, that the changes will take about 2 days to
          appear in the zip-archive.

          in revision 4561 I have added a test script based on the code below.

          It now works fine with the latest version of fieldtrip. I will attach the figures that I get. The layout is not ideal, because a bit asymmetric, but that probably reflects the position of the helmet relative to the head. The size of the helmet looks ok for a pediatric system.
