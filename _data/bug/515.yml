          This difference is actually most striking when looking at the NAI figures.

          One change in the code which may be not inconsequential is a change in the computation of the forward solution. For the singleshell method, a scaling was removed (this scaling assumed fT and cm as units); the new scaling assumed SI units, i.e. T and m. Although I don't think that this would have led to anything else than a difference in magnitude of the leadfields, the plots suggest differently.
