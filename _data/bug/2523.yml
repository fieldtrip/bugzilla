          I can see why many people would want this, but as far as I remember the reason why it is not implemented is because:
          a) there is no gold-standard what method to use, and also no objective way to determine one

          To back up Jorn: see bug 532.

          Maybe for clarity it should be called ft_phaseamplitude rather than CFC?  Unless the idea is to generalise it to other types of CFC later.

          I think it could do various cross-frequency measures, also power-power, phase-phase etc. The overall structure of dealing with freq twice would be shared and probably the computational details are similar enough to accommodate all of them.

        thetext: Yes , we can implement different methods (e.g. phase locking value , mean vector length ,cross spectrum coherence , modulation index...).   At this moment, I have two major concerns . First ,  some  method is quite computational expensive (e.g Modulation index).  Another problem is that no one reported  frequency *frequency comodulogram  CFC so far on MEG data to my knowledge.  The existed papers only showed specific frequency pair coupling. Therefore , we need to find a dataset . Nevertheless , I am going to try to my MEG data first.

          Hi Eelke,
             Thanks for pointing it out. I didn't know that we had plans to implement this long time ago! Of course , it is a lot of work. Ignorant and fearless newbie is taking the challenge. I think it  does make sense to implement some widely-used CFC measures and then it is up to the users choose . We can go step by step.  The main issue is the time and computation load  if you think (multiple channels /trials; loop for high frequency  and low frequency/ cross-channels) or even later statistic. Actually I and Ole are speeding the code right now.  After I submit my paper to Journal of Neuroscience Methods special issue (the deadline is the end of May),  I am going to incorporate  with Fieldtrip. You are most welcome to have a joint effort . Later , we can also consider implementing the cross-frequency directionality stuff in Fieldtip.

          bummer! I accidentally also committed changes to three other functions.

          The change to msphere is minor.

          The change to refine pertains to a planned functionality enhancement, it now has "fix me" in the relevant piece of code. It should not hurt anyone.

          ft_freqstatistics is messed up, so I will revert it to the previous version (more or less). The part of the code that I'll remove is based on this

          Hi Robert,
             Thanks for the initializing.  It works pretty good . I am very happy that you and Dieog join the development.  To make this function more powerful , we might need some sub functions to make it more extensive like 'ft_connectivityanalysis (ft_connectivity_dtf,ft_connectivity_pdf,etc)'.   Thus, we can  have ft_crossfrequency_mvl,ft_crossfrequency_mi,ft_crossfrequency_plv) subfunctions as well. Of course , we can support time-dynamic CFC in these subfunctions. Let us implement this first and then test the influence on the way  how we estimate the phase/power as we discussed  in the FT meeting.

          right now the low level functions are relatively small and therefore I do not yet see the need for having them outside the main ft_crossfrequencyanalysis function. We have done this for ft_conenctivityanalysis, but maintaining the two sets of function is also work.

          Let's put this on the agenda for Wednesday.

          If no one wants to do it (as it seems), I've planned to do it at some piont. If there's no rush I'll contribute with CFC measures like bicoherence, cross-frequency coherence, weighted-phase locking factor... I can use the simulations of my thesis to write down a wiki example script or minitutorial about how the distinct CFC provide spurious correlations.

            Hi Deigo, I am fine if you take over. I don't have time for this in the next a few months anyway (leaving Holland this month, one month holiday in China, moving to US....). Nevertheless, the core code ft_crossfreqanalysis I wrote before is over there. We can add more CFC measures and write down a detailed tutorial.  Digeo, you have my own CFC implementation (independent of FT ) as well, so it shouldn't be too difficult to merge. As you pointed out, it is also important to keep in mind how artifactual CFC generates. We should make readers be aware of this. Overall, I think a joint effort with you will be best. Let me know how do you think.

          Thanks for your reply Haiteng.  Not clear to me if you want to take over or not. Given you've your own CFC implementation (outside of FT) and it's easy to merge, I propose you to merge it. In the end, I create my own CFC functions to deal with MEG data and I've to start from scratch anyway to follow FT flow (new CFC measures, channel pairs support, etc). If you don't have the time, I'll take over ;)

          Hi Robert,

          Work on this has indeed stalled, your contribution on this would be very welcome!

          I suggest that you go through http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/git and that you make a branch in which you develop this functionality. That allows for easy reviewing and commenting on the code, without messing up the stable release version along the way. You can then send a pull request, which we can review and merge.

          Furthermore, it would be very valuable to see the (user) interface of the function at work in a test script (in fieldtrip/test), which is part of that branch. Most important in that test script is to demonstrate how it would work. Showing the correctness of the methods would also be nice, but is a second concern. My experience is that the details of the user interface sometimes need discussion in order to align the new functionality with FieldTrip in general. The script could start with simulating data with a few channels and random data.
