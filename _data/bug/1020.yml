          Hi Philip,

          This bug and its fix seem straightforward. Could you check the fix that is suggested on your system? If it does not cause other problems, please reassign it to me and I'll take it into the release code and compiled version.

          best
          Robert

          PS @Anais: thanks for the report and suggested fix!

          Fortunately, I found the old version of the gcc-compiler (4.0.1) on my computer, which made me compiling and running biosemi2ft with no complaint about the library.
          I did a quick test by sending events to the buffer every 30 ms, and reading 1 sec. of data for each incoming event (loop-test via BrainStream).
          I kept it running for a couple of minutes, and it did run without errors. I did not verify the data since nobody was in the cap.
          If you need further testing, just let me know.

          The fixed bug, could it also lead to receiving an event with wrong sample value zero? According to the code, I think it should only happen if events were received in a very short time interval. Am I right?

At the moment I don''t know whether that is the case. I suggest that Boris checks that the date of the compiled versions is later than the date of the fixed c-file, or that the SVN revision numbers are consistent with the executables being up to date.'

          yes, I have tested it locally on my own machine. The compilation needs to be done for all dependencies on all platforms, so it is quite some work.
