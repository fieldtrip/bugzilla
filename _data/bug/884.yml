        thetext: "the event structure is standardized and should contain exactly the same fields for all formats. It cannot be that for micromed there would be another strucutre. Please remove the urevent field and stick to the standard.\n \nand please move the snippet of code following read_micromed_event from ft_read_event into that special function. There is no reason to have the code split over the two functions."
