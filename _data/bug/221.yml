        thetext: "The same holds for ft_timelockstatistics I assume. In case on gives output from ft_freqgrandaverage to ft_freqstatistics with cfg.method = montecarlo, it results in the rather non-informative error in statistics_montecarlo:\n\n??? Error using ==> statistics_montecarlo at 217\ncould not determine the parametric critical value for clustering\n\nError in ==> statistics_wrapper at 285\n    [stat, cfg] = statmethod(cfg, dat, cfg.design, 'issource',issource);\n\nError in ==> ft_freqstatistics at 127\n  [stat, cfg] = statistics_wrapper(cfg, varargin{:}); \n\n\nA dimord-check somewhere along the line should throw an error at the appropriate function, and one that is more informative, e.g.: \"input from ft_freq/timelockgrandaverage not supported\"."

        thetext: The error is not non-informative, but results from the fact that 'the parametric critical value for clustering' could not be determined. Output of ft_freqgrandaverage can be swallowed (and should be) if cfg.keepindividual = 'yes'. This results in a dimord of 'subj_chan_freq(_time)', and works just fine (last time I checked. The error is most likely caused by the fact that the specific 'statfun' doesn't have a snippet of code included which can actually perform the parametric threshold computation. In general this holds for those statfuns which have not been contributed by Eric.

        thetext: Hmmm, in this case that wasn't true apparently. The input was two structures, each with a dimord of 'subj_etc..', using 'depsamplesT' as statfun. I will look into it further, as probably something else went wrong then.

        thetext: Ouch, after some debugging it appeared the end-user just accidentally switched the cfg.ivar and cfg.uvar variables, making the design matrix bogus. I will look into a better error message, see what is going one.
