        thetext: "It now reads\n\n%   cfg.directionality     = '', 'inflow' or 'outflow' specifies for\n%                            connectivity measures whether the inflow into a\n%                            node, or the outflow from a node is plotted. The\n%                            behavior of this option depends on the input\n%                            data. If the input data is of dimord\n%                            'chan_chan_XXX', the value of directionality\n%                            determines whether, given the reference\n%                            channel(s), the columns (inflow), or rows\n%                            (outflow) are selected for plotting. In this\n%                            situation the default is 'inflow'. Note that for\n%                            undirected measures, inflow and outflow should\n%                            give the same output. When the input data is of \n%                            dimord 'chancmb_XXX', the value\n%                            of directionality determines whether the rows in\n%                            data.labelcmb are selected. With 'inflow' the\n%                            rows are selected if the refchannel(s) occur in\n%                            the right column, with 'outflow' the rows are\n%                            selected if the refchannel(s) occur in the left\n%                            column of the labelcmb-field. Default in this\n%                            case is '', which means that all rows are\n%                            selected in which the refchannel(s) occur. This\n%                            is to robustly support linearly indexed\n%                            undirected connectivity metrics. In the situation \n%                            where undirected connectivity measures are\n%                            linearly indexed, specifying 'inflow' or\n%                            'outflow' can result in unexpected behavior.\n\nwhich makes it very difficult to parse. I suggest giving a short reference-manual style description, which is elaborated upon in a subsequent separate section of the help"
