          There is a problem in the local sphere handling, which manifests itself as holes in the beamformer volume (i.e. indicating an inside/outside problem).

          The vol is modified by the call to prepare_headmodel (line 145 of
          ft_prepare_leadfield). If you do

          load prep_ls_input
          ft_plot_mesh(cfg.headshape, 'vertexcolor', 'k');
          vol = ft_prepare_localspheres(cfg)
          sens = cfg.grad;

          [vol, sens] = ft_prepare_vol_sens(vol, sens, 'channel',
          ft_channelselection('MEG', sens.label), 'order', 10);

          [bnd.pnt, bnd.tri] = headsurface(vol, sens, 'inwardshift', 0,
          'surface', 'skin');

          figure;ft_plot_mesh(bnd)

          Then you can reproduce the problem.

        thetext: "I have spotted the bug by comparing the situation with all versus meg as channelselection. \n\nIf you consider the original (G3BR) sens.tra, you would have something like in attached screenshot.\n\nIf you select MEG channels, the bottom 40 rows are removed (but not the last 40 columns). The consequence is that the sphere selection for those coils is based on the max contribution to one of the MEG channels, whereas it should be on the respective REF channel (the REF spheres are global spheres, not local). \n\nSo that is the difference, which then causes a difference in the estimated head surface, which is then used for the inside/outside detection. But the consequence is also that the MEG leadfield is suboptimal (because of the suboptimal sphere) for the REF coils and hence that the G3BR correction is suboptimal.\n\nThe solution is that channel and coil selection have to be postponed until after the sphere-shuffling."

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
