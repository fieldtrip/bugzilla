        thetext: "Created attachment 524\nscreenshot of the error\n\nDuring the stimulation toolkit, some participants encountered a strange problem with databrowser that jumping back and forth between marked epochs resulted in an error because the function wants to access the 0th element of a matrix. I attached a screenshot. I have no clue how they managed to get this error, but I remember that I could reproduce it by some randomly executing the zooming command, marking some epochs and jumping between the epochs. However, since it was during the toolkit, I did not spend more time with digging into the code. \nI would propose to play around with the toolkit data and the databrowser whilehaving enabled 'dbstop if error' and hope for the error to occur again."

          Assigned to a named person, to push forward the resolution of this bug.
          Otherwise it just adds to the 'stuwmeer' of unassigned bugs, that nobody feels
          responsible for.

          Pull requested.

          Artifact browsing works again, and is now robust to artifacts that overlap with multiple trials, and to artifacts not present in any trial.
