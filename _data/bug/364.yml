        thetext: "In the tutorials data is written to disk and later read in again. This is so that people cab start halfway in teh tutorial, or skip teh lengthy steps. \n\nHence, the ftp server should contain all mat files that are used in the tutorials. And the tutorials should point to the mat files. \n\nI noticed that the eventrelatedaveraging tutorial does not have a corresponding folder on the ftp server. It should be created, and the tutorial mat files should be made and copied into it. \n\nThe same thing should be checked for all other tutorials!"

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
