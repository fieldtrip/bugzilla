        thetext: "Even better magic.\n\nCheck the feasibility of dragging the data (hand-symbol-pointer of course) left and right, i.e. shift the time-axis with small amounts and redraw. \nMaybe the redefinetrialing/redrawing/etc doesn't have to occur, and there is some figure-wizardy for actually shifting the data/axis-system in view (i.e. part of the axis hidden off-screen and off-figure)? Oh my god the possibilities are endless. Wishful thinking?"

          have you looked into the scrollbar stuff, not quite sure if that helps though, but you might want to have a look (I don't remember anymore, too long ago)

        thetext: "A quote from the file-exchange that will be very handy\"\n\"From your other post in this thread, it appears that you're replotting the \ndata each time the slider's callback executes. There's no need to do this; \nplot all the data at once and simply have the slider's callback change the \nlimits of the axes with AXIS, XLIM, YLIM, or SET. Alternately, if that's \nnot an option don't call PLOT each time, but use SET to update the XData \nand/or YData properties of the line you've already drawn. One final option \nis to set the BusyAction property on the slider to avoid queuing up so many \ninvocations of the callback function.\"\n\nThis might be a way to allow very small shifts with very fast updates, testing this with a test function now."

        thetext: Hmmm, this axis updating business is pretty darn fast! Gonna try and hack some eeglab functions now, as googling 'data scrolling matlab' surprisingly brought me to eeglab. On the website it says 'high density data-scrolling', maybe they have some extra-smart stuff built-in?
