          Problem:
          Time-out parameter that is used in peercellfun is too tight and leads to numerous job-resubmissions. The compute time of the peers can be variable due to load from other users and/or variable compute load (e.g. when involving optimization processes). Moreover, resubmission of a job can interfere with the original job (e.g. both jobs changing the same file) and can thus be undesirable (a show stopper).

          Suggested solution:
          Add an optional 'ResubmitTime' field in peercellfun (e.g. ranging from 3 to infinity) that allows the user to control (relax) the resubmit behaviour.

          has been implemented in revision 2296

          the timcv option has been removed, and a more transparent ResubmitTime option has been implemented instead
