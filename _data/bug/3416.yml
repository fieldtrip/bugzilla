          An example dataset and a script to go with it that shows the problem.

          Hello there.

          I'm working on an analysis pipeline for brain-speech coherence, and I've run into a problem that I can't seem to solve.. Bacially, I want my coherence spectrum to only contain gradiometer data, but when I try and select MEGGRAD for the channel combination I get an empty coherence spectrum... And when I try to select MEGGRAD for the FFT and either MEG or MEGGRAD for the coherence, I get the following error:

          Index exceeds matrix dimensions.

          Error in ft_channelcombination (line 173)
            collect = [datachannel(indx(:,1)) datachannel(indx(:,2))];

          Error in ft_connectivityanalysis (line 174)
              cfg.channelcmb = ft_channelcombination(cfg.channelcmb, tmpchan, 1);

          Error in coherence_channelcmb_problem (line 68)
          AudCoh = ft_connectivityanalysis(cfg, FreqFourier_Aud);

          Help?

          I've attached a script with an example dataset that replicates the problems.

        thetext: please try and upload a small dataset, that at least consists of a data.label field. Otherwise, try a bit more yourself in terms of debuggin, e.g. type dbstop if error on the command line, or put a breakpoint in ft_channelcombination at line 173, and inspect  the variables 'datachannel', and 'indx'. These apparently do not match matlab's expectations.

This suggests that there is a problem (at least with the fieldtrip version you are using: have you checked that you are using the latest version of the code? The reason I ask is because I have not been able to reproduce your problem on my end) with how the 'wildcard' syntax tries to extract the relevant channels from the datastructure at hand.\n\nAll this said:\nPlease first ensure that you have the latest version of the code, and if the problem persists, try to break it down to the lowest level at which the problem can be identified."
