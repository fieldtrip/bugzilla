        thetext: I noticed the front page showed an RSS feed from the surfnet maillist. This is no longer the current list, so I removed it, but there's no alternative at the moment. There's a FIXME in place of the old RSS feed

          Just to add some more information, there appears to be a patch for RSS support in mailman since around 2003, however it has never been fully integrated, so native RSS support is still lacking in mailman.

          Perhaps a hack is required to add this feature?
          There's a hack here: http://taint.org/mmrss/

          perhaps that will be good enough?

          the mmrss tool, seems like a good option to re-enable this functionality, it requires perl and the "libxml-rss-perl" module (this is the debial package name, the actual module is: XML/RSS.pm )

          it requires a cron job to write a decent RSS file and then this can be loaded into the wiki.

          Move it to my crontab. I have more wiki maintenance stuff running.

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
