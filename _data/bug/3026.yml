          line 267 applies in the case of "hasdata", which is set at line 254 as

          hasdata = exist('data', 'var');

          it is unclear to me where that variable comes from. Did you specify cfg.inputfile, causing "ft_preamble loadvar data" to read the data? If so, cfg.trl does rightfully not apply.

        thetext: No cfg.inputfile, but i may have used cfg.dataset. Would that cause the same behavior? On the airport right now, will check when back.

          Did you fix this already? It seems hasdata = exist('data', 'var'); now throws a zero under the same circumstances. As a result, the cfg.trl is no longer forbidden. Considering this fixed.
