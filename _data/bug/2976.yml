          My script runs the line:

          >> data = ft_rejectartifact(cfg,data);

          And gets the error:

             Reference to a cleared variable data.

             Error in ft_rejectartifact (line 520)
               cfg = data;

          I tracked it down to ft_postamble_savevar, line 48:

             if ~nargout
                 % do not return the output variable "ans"
                 clear(ft_default.postamble{1});
             end

          The Matlab editor gives a warning:

             Use of 'nargout' in a script will be removed in a future release.

          Since this is a script, I'm not exactly sure where it's supposed to be getting the nargout from, but my call to ft_rejectartifact did request an output, so I guess it should be there.

          I've run this code successfully for a while now, and just ran into this problem *I think* when I upgraded to R2015b, so it may be a change in how this release handles something.  I did try updating to the latest version of FieldTrip (9/30/15) to be sure it wasn't something you had already found and fixed.

          Let me know if you're able to replicate the problem or need any more info.

          Thanks,
          Teresa

        thetext: Just thought I'd add, it still crashes (on the same line & with the same error) when I run ft_rejectartifact without an output variable.  My workaround is just to leave cfg.outputfile off and save the data after.

          (In reply to Teresa Madsen from comment #1)

          Hi Theresa,

          I made some updates to the pre and postamble handling on Friday. It mainly had to do with ordering, and not with the error you reported. See https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/1c51eaf2bcc7a41103e5f7b8c42fb9129916d93b

          But I also noticed the 2015b warning. So far we have not yet targeted version 2015b, but we should. I have renamed the bug description and will try to pinpoint the problems with the post amble and 2015b.
