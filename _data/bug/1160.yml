          ...given data that should be treated continuously, yet does not start at time point 0.

          Not sure whether this also happens for other inputs; diagnosis is needed.

          It turns out that selecting data segments (either for marking or for passing to the selfun) did not work in general when the data set only has one trial. I tracked this to a non-zero offset being added to the trlvis only when there was a single trial, and making the offset vector start at zero when there was more than one trial. I changed this to always add the newly-initialised offset vector. (Code changed around lines 637-649.)
