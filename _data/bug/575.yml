          since cfg.method is already used to specify the stats method, e.g. cfg.method = 'montecarlo'

          please fix

          whoopsy :/ and I was so sure that by providing a default, this would not affect any other functions, but I did not test the case that the function would actually be called from other functions.

          thanks for providing the fix! As I will be on vacation from this night on, I cannot look into this anymore. Anyway, we might want to change the name of method for neighbourselection then.
