          ft_multiplotER is a rather slow function with a lot of the drag due to a large number of keyval executions.  Attached is data and a cfg to be used with the following:

          ft_multiplotER(cfg,att_dep_ipsi)

        thetext: "Attached is a new version of ft_multiplotER which uses a different approach to plotting the data.  Rather than representing that data as line objects in a singular axes object, the following system us used:\n\n1) 1 'reference' axes object is generated which serves as the reference frame.  This object is used as the common position reference for all further objects.\n\n2) further objects are contained in separate axes objects with sizes and positions referenced to the 'reference axes'.  Layouts are displayed in the reference axes, as is the comment text.  \n\nThis system allows for rapid plotting compared to the previous version, and also allows for faster realtime updating of objects using handles than using the line object handles in the previous incarnation (for unknown reasons).\n\nImplementation of interactive zooming and panning has been implemented to demonstrate the reasoning for the changes.\n\nFull compatibility with all previous multiplotER functionality still needs to be completed, but the current attached version suffices for testing/proof of concept purposes.\n\nA bug in the interactive plotting seems to exist for the mac OS, though interactive plotting is fully functional in Unix.  I'm not sure what the Windows situation is."
