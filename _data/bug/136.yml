          at the moment the peer announce packet always contains the TCP port number, even when the tcpserver is not running. With the new udsserver, it is possible to only use UDS for communication. In that case you want the TPC port to be specified as "unavailable", just like the socket is specified as "unavailable" (by means of host->socket="").

          I suggest that host->port is renamed to host->tcpport and that a value of 0 indicates that the tcpserver is not available. That should be set as default in peerinit.
