          this has been fixed this morning (also because of bug 408)

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
