        thetext: "There is an error when the function ft_volumerealign.m is called with \ncfg.method = 'interactive';\ncfg.viewmode = 'surface'; \nin order to specify the fiducial position using the mouse.\nIt's just a location issue because the function select3d is needed and should be located in this folder: fieldtrip/private\nHowever select3d is only found in: fieldtrip/plotting/private\nMaybe this function should be located in both private folders to prevent this error.\nThanks !"
