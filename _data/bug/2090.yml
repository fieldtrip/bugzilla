          Would be handy if, like ft_databrowser, the command-line would be released if no output arguments are requested.

        thetext: OK, if this is wished for behavior, I suggest to check how it's done in ft_databrowser, and implement this for ft_rejectvisual. shouldn't be too much work. something for Johanna to look into?

        thetext: I think I filed this logged in as me during a FT meeting (check date and time of bug filed), but it was Roemer that reported/requested/noticed it.  Perhaps he has more of an idea if he knows ft_databrowser more?  or Joern?

          discussed 2014-10-08: it seems that the return to the command line is not in line with what the function is expected to do. since we have the data already in memory, it would be a bit foolish to use the function to write down on paper which trials to reject (which is the only way we could come up with to use this function without output requested).

          Set to wontfix.


          PS: additional discussion was related to whether the function should return a data structure (inconsistent with general FT-behavior of the ft_artifact_xxx functions, whereas it is in line with ft_rejectartifact) or just a cfg.
          For backward incompatibility reasons we decided to keep the output as is. (the cfg is available from the data anyway).
