          Hi Leo, Jan-Mathijs

          I also have the same problem. When appending data from 2 datasets the trialinfo and sampleinfo only contains info from the first dataset. And I need the information to know which trials belong to each condition. I fixed it for my data by concatenating the trialinfo and sampleinfo field myself. You just need to make sure that the funtions you use afterwards do not depend on the sampleinfo field, because this is not correct any more as Jan-Mathijs explained.
          I'm not sure if this is the best thing to do, but it works for me!

          Best, Marianne

          Hi Leo,

          With 'trl', are you referring to data.cfg.previous. ... .trl? I assume that data.trial (which contains the actual data) has the correct dimensionality of 1x605?
          In the past, fieldtrip also concatenated the trl-matrices, but we feel that this is not appropriate. The reason for this is, that the first 2 columns of these matrices represent the sample numbers that define the epochs of interest, with respect to the first sample in the recording. If the concatenated data are derived from two different datasets, these numbers become meaningless, because they cannot be interpreted unequivocally anymore. Yet, and I hope that this was motivating your question, the trl-matrix was also used (by some) to store trial-specific information, which of course still is meaningful even if the data comes from different recordings. If this indeed relates to your question, please have a look at: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/i_used_to_work_with_trl-matrices_that_have_more_than_3_columns._why_is_this_not_supported_anymore

          If your actual question is of a different nature, could you please explain a bit more what is the problem?

          Thanks,

          Jan-Mathijs

          Hello
          thanks in advance for your assistance.
          I'd like to merge 2 datasets after preprocessing using ft_appendata.
          Even though it works on first view, "trl" does not add up but keeps the structure of the last dataset (304 in the example):

          XY_merge=ft_appenddata(cfg, x1, x2);
          input dataset 1, 29 channels, 301 trials
          input dataset 2, 29 channels, 304 trials
          Warning: input data comes from different datafiles
          In ft_appenddata at 182
          concatenating the trials over all datasets
          removing sampleinfo field from output
          output dataset, 29 channels, 605 trials

          Do I miss the point ?

          Thanks
          Best regards
          Leopold

          I suggest to write a simple test script to validate this and fix it if necessary.

        thetext: "Marianne, I added you to the CC list of this bug. I created a test script (test/test_bug946.m; code follows below as well), which seems to succeed for me. Could you check whether your problem persists in the latest version of Fieldtrip? (And with my test script?) I made some small changes to ft_appenddata, which are apparently unrelated to this, but might make a difference.\n\n===\nTest script: \n\n% make some dummy data\ndata1 = [];\ndata1.trial = repmat({rand(10,100)},1,10);\ndata1.time = repmat({0.01:1},1,10);\ndata1.label = {'CH01','CH02','CH03','CH04','CH05','CH06','CH07','CH08','CH09','CH10'};\ndata1.fsample = 100;\ndata1.sampleinfo(:,1) = 1:100:901;\ndata1.sampleinfo(:,2) = 100:100:1000;\ndata1.trialinfo = (1:10)';\n\ndata2 = data1;\ndata2.sampleinfo = data2.sampleinfo + 1000;\ndata2.trialinfo = (11:20)';\n\n% perform concatenation\ncfg = [];\nconcat = ft_appenddata(cfg, data1, data2);\n\n% check whether trialinfo and sampleinfo are correct\ntestSampleInfo = concat.sampleinfo==cat(1,data1.sampleinfo,data2.sampleinfo);\ntestTrialInfo = concat.trialinfo==cat(1,data1.trialinfo,data2.trialinfo);\n\nwrong = [];\nif ~all(testSampleInfo(:))\n  wrong = [wrong 'sampleinfo,'];\nend\nif ~all(testTrialInfo(:))\n  wrong = [wrong 'trialinfo,'];\nend\nif ~isempty(wrong)\n  error([wrong(1:end-1) ' not concatenated properly']);\nend"
