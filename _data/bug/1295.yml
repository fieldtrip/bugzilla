          Now it seems that ft_volumerealign cannot deal correctly with a left-handed volume (so probably needs a flipdim in one of the dimensions to work correctly in this case).

          first create a test script that implements a sphere in a volume with well defined 'landmarks'.
          then see what happens when the transformation matrix / orientation of volume are manipulated.
          determine whether robust detection of volume handedness can be achieved (possibly using ft_determine_coordsys)
          investigate the suitability of a general purpose flipping function to enforce right-handed volumes, or the suitability of working with left-handed volumes in a correct way.
          also check the functionality in ft_volumesegment, because some flipping is done there too.

        thetext: it has been decided that a particular handedness will not be imposed onto the data. Rather, ft_volumerealign now supports an additional control point to be specified that allows for a consistent transformation matrix, even if there is a mismatch between the handedness of the input and output coordinate system axes.
