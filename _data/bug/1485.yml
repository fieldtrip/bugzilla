          To make sure you got the point of my previous comment: why don't you just make tiny changes like this yourself and commit them directly? Should be less work than filing a bug in bugzilla...

          (see also e.g. bug 1484: one ft_checkconfig('renamed') call would do the trick)

        thetext: Perhaps all FT team members should have a reasonably up-to-date working copy of the SVN repository. (I 'svn update' basically each morning--takes 5 seconds, never had a conflict.)

          I don't need to know what you do for 5 seconds every morning.

          Lets keep it bug related and discuss work-ethics offline.
