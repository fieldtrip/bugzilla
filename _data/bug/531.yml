        thetext: "When input data has variable time axes across trials. \nPresent functionality seems to be an cumulative sum over trials, including explicitly putting the 'nans' per trial to nan. This runs the risk of ending up with all nan data.\n\ne.g. when there are two trials in the data structure, one with the time axis running from -0.5 to 0 and the orther one with the time axis running from 0 to 0.5"

        thetext: I made a fix which I did not yet commit, because the adjusted version of ft_freqanalysis also contains new functionality to suppress output to the screen. This will only work properly if ft_progress is added to specest/private. Have to wait for Robert to explain to me how this should be done.

        thetext: forget about my last remark; of course I can commit the change, because ft_progress is in utilities, which IS visible when the specest function is called by ft_freqanalysis (because this assumes utilities to be on the path). To keep specest as a separate module ft_progress does not need to be added to specest/private at all, because ft_progress will only be called if the caller function is ft_freqanalysis (same issue as above).
