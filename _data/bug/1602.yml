          In ft_selectdata_new there is a for loop at line 419 (for i=1:numel(varargin)) that shouldn't be there. There is no varargin in the internal function getselection_freq().

          two more things:
          line 420 asks: if numel(cfg.latency)==1
          it should ask about cfg.frequency

          line 435 sets cfg.latency = data.freq([fbeg fend]);, when it should be setting cfg.frequency.

        thetext: Also, there are a bunch of keyboard commands. I guess this isn't ready for prime time and I should stick with ft_selectdata_old. Sorry if this is bringing up known issues.

          Hi Matt,

          Thanks for reporting this. I just pushed the changes to the repository (revision 6244).
          Could I ask you to test if it now works with this version?

          Thanks,

          JM

        thetext: The bugs seem fixed. However, with freq data it still hits the keyboard command on line 202 (which is understandable because it seems like there's still a lot more to implement).

          Hi Matt,

          Thanks. Yeah, you have two options here: either use ft_selectdata_old, or keep feeding us with patches to ft_selectdata_new, so that eventually this guy will work, too. ;-)
          Apparently the team needs some extrinsic motivation to push this one into functionality...
