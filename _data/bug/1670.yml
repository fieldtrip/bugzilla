        thetext: Right now it shows the dokuwiki-icon in the address bar, people's bookmarks, and tabs. This should be an FT-specific icon.

          the original logo in eps - made using Adobe Illustrator

          note that on my laptop at this moment the font for "FieldTrip" is missing, and is replaced by an ugly courier-like font. Probably I have the right font on my desktop computer. See also the bitmap version.

          I also have smaller bitmap versions if needs be.

          Done! It's perhaps a bit teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-esque but at least it's better than the dokuwiki-version.

          (A refresh or browser restart might be needed to see the icon.)

        thetext: On chrome windows, the icon only appears in the tab at the top, but not to the left of 'fieldtrip.donders.nl' on the address bar.  I have closed and reopened my browser.  but actually, I realise now that's the case for all my tabs open (none of them show the icon in the address bar, only tab at top).

          (In reply to comment #5)
          That is indeed the case :) It's a feature of chrome and I believe firefox too nowadays, to avoid websites 'faking' an SSL-lock icon in that location.

          Looks nice, I like it!
          (and now I also see the resemblance to the turtles :))
