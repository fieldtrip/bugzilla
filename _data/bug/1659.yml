          see http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_are_the_different_head_and_mri_coordinate_systems_defined

          There is documentation (in pdf form) for CTF, BTi and other systems and we should insert some screenshots out of those PDFs into the FAQ for clarification.

          Or perhaps put them in the system specific getting started (like in http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/getting_started/yokogawa#meg_dewar_coordinate_system) and refer from the FAQ to those sections

          uploaded ctf and neuromag headcoordinate system images, and added some links from yokogawa getting started to head coordinate system faq

          still in need for more screenshots of head coordinate system, preferably for 4d/bti, itab, yokogawa, besa?, polhemus?, dicom?/analyze?/nifti?, mni, freesurfer

        thetext: added headcoordinate system image for BTI. closing this bug considering illustrations for the common systems have been provided (i.e. ctf, neuromnag, bti), or links to them (e.g. freesurfer)
