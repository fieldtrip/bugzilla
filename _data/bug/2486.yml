          Note that our current reader only supports MFF version 3. The three files that your test script uses are in an older format. Would you mind replacing them with files in the version 3 format? We have an app that converts older MFF versions to the newest version, and I can supply you with converted versions of the test files.

        thetext: "(In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #0)\n\nThere appears to be an unfortunate naming confusion, which I understand as\n\n- fieldtrip implementation egi_mff_v1 and egi_mff_v2\n- mff dataset format v2 and v3. I guess there is also v1, and possibly intermediate versions (e.g. 1.5, 2.1)\n\nThe egi_mff_v1 does not use Java or any EGI code. \nThe egi_mff_v2 uses the Java implementation from EGI and is the one we shoudl continue to work on.\n\nThe comment by Colin states that the latest jar file (at this moment not yet in the fieldtrip distribution) only works with the dataset format v3.\n\nThere exists a converter that converts v2 datasets to v3. Does it also convert v1 datasets to v3? Is it available for all platforms (windows, linux)"

        thetext: "Robert, to answer your questions: \n\n-- The converter converts all earlier mff format versions (0, 1 and 2) to the current version (3). \n\n-- The converter is only available on Macs, since our main product is a Mac product. \n\nWhat is the best way to get you converted versions of the test data? Or would it be best to just send you the converter?"

        thetext: I suggest removing the file Long64ChannelWithEvents from the test script. It turns out there are some problems with this file. We can supply other files to use for testing purposes.
