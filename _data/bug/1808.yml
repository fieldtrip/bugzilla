This is especially a problem if there are EEG-channels at the beginning of the channel list, since n is increasing but because of the EEG-channel the else-branch is invoked and n and k and not further \"compatible\"\n\nCheers,\nTim"

          Hi Tim,

          Just from reading the code I don't yet understand how the presence of electrodes could cause the line 114 elseif section to be executed and not the line 134 else section.

          do you have a (small) data file that we could use to pinpoint the problem?

          at the beginning of the channels there were 25 EEG
          channels followed by 306 MEG channels.

          if the grad structure is built, the loop is 25 times (EEG) in the
          else-section, i.e. n increases to 26 but k is still 1.

          If now the MEG channels begin, the if-section looks for magnetometer,
          which is found at n=27 and k  becomes 2. that is good. the next channel
          MUST be a gradiometer though. that means that at n=28 the loop should
          end in the elseif-section, but because orig.chs(k) does not look for the
          28th channel but for k instead, the loop actually looks at channel 2
          again. I thought, that the k in the elseif-statement must be changed to
          an n.

          ---

          where is orig.chs(k) being used? Might it be that you are looking at an older version of the file?

          See http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/browse/trunk/fileio/private/mne2grad.m for the latest.

          > The question is: why is this one channel missing?



          K>> dbstack
          > In fileio/private/mne2grad at 101
            In ft_read_header at 1260

          K>> length(strmatch('MEG', {orig.chs.ch_name}))
          ans =
             305

          So the channel is actually missing from the structure returned by the fif reading functions. Hence I would conclude that mne2grad is performing correctly in returning 305 channels. However, there is still an issue with the channelposition function.
