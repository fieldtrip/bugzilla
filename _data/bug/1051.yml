          Doing nothing strange (except dealing with preprocessed data that was processed a while ago)

          breaks in fixsens on line 62, because line 39 = false.

          cheers,
          S

          The statement is confusing: does it or does it not have coilpos?
          Also, please provide some more details: what was the main function called?

I.e. adding coilpos/coilori and removing pnt? \nI don't know whether this is a bug, or whether it is the consequence of the gradiometer description not being complete. If you add a chanpos by hand it should just work, or not?"

        thetext: thats the thing - if i used a workaround i wouldn't report it, but i cant find my own handywork anywhere. Then i wanted to add chanpos myself but was unsure what that would have to look like?

        thetext: it goes wrong in ft_megplanar, when the planarmontage is put into ft_apply_montage; at this point the chanpos gets lost, which is not good
