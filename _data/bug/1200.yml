(It is probable that I haven't checked last time, if the problem disappeared because I have already started to use an older version of FieldTrip due to the problem. So, it is just possible that the problem hasn't been solved.)\n\n When I try to start to use FieldTrip (28.11.2011 version) it is crashing.\n\nI attached the script that I used.\n\nAddpath, ft_defaults works fine, but when I try to run ft_sourcegrandaverage I get a system error and matlab crashes (but last time this happened with ft_read_mri function, so I suspect it doesn't depend on the actual function used). I am using Matlab2008b on the MPI grid. I do not have this problem with the earlier version of FieldTrip (like 2011 01 26).\n\nLilla"

          I tried the script on a 2010b version of Matlab, and it is running!
          But I could try this because 2010b is installed locally on my PC. At the MPI, we can use only Matlab 2008b on the grid. (I have asked, they haven't installed any newer version).

          hey,

          our system administrator has upgraded the linux system, but I can't check yet if FieldTrip works properly now, because I can't login to our linux machines due to some after-effect of the upgrade :). Hopefully, I can do it in a few days. I'll let you know.
          Best,

          Hi Boris,
          our linux system has been updated (it is linux 64 using enterprise version 10, service pack 4) but I still have the same problem. I am clueless why.

          hey,

          you can find data and script in /home/language/lilmag/beamforming_stat

          The script you find there crashes under my matlab at the mpi grid. We use matlab 2008b, but when I try the exactly the same script on the donders mentats with matlab 2008b, it is running perfectly. You can find attached the output of the crash.

          And this is only one example because the crash happens basically any time, the matlab encounters a fieldtrip function. (Except of ft_defaults. I can get only until here.)

          I tried also that I did not do addpath.... and ft_defaults (either in matlab command window or in startup.m) but I set the path myself in the menu with "add folder with its subdirectories". But I got the same error.

          Interestingly, older fieldtrip versions (for example, 2011 06 23) are running fine. I do not know which fieldtrip version is the earliest that I can not run anymore.

          It is not only at the mpi who has this problem, so it doesn't depend on my personal settings of matlab. (but may there is some default setting here why it is not working.)
