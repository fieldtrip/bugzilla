          See also bug 658. For systems with both magnetometers and gradiometers, the power values might be in different orders of magnitude.

          @Eliezer: I assume the missing channels in your example figure were due to a channel selection, right? Or was them missing also part of the bug? I did not get any missing channels.

        thetext: Yes, that was due to channel selection. That was a particularly noisy dataset :)

        thetext: This should be implemented in the next version. Could you let me know if it works out, Eli? I was only able to test it with simulated data, we have no proper Neuromag-306 test data here.
