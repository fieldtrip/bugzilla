          Hi Robert,
          I didn't understand why qsubcellfun was running old versions of matlab when I submitted functions to the cluster, so I looked into the code. The reason is in qsubfeval (line 169-202), where the matlab version is retreived. This only supports versions up to 2012b and therefore is outdated. Could this perhaps be changed in the near future?
          Best,
          Tim
