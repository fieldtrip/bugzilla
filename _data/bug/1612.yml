          Hi Yu Huang,

          I don't understand the cfg you supplied. It seems as if you specify many options, but it is not clear to me which 'method' you actually try to apply. The cfg suggests 'fiducial', whereas your question pertains to a headshape based alignment.

        thetext: I was trying to align the electrode coordinates stored in cfg.elec to the headshape based on three fiducials of that headshape, so the method should be 'fiducial'. The problem is the headshape is not in CTF orientation, so ft_electroderealign cannot correctly align it onto that headshape (new electrodes are far away from the headshape). But if I specified ITAB orientation in line 387 & 388 of ft_electroderealign() where it calls headcoordinates(), the result is correct (although the electrodes are not all exactly on the surface of the head, they are basically around the head). So I was wondering if ft_electroderealign() should add an argument of headshape orientation. Thanks!

          I still don't fully understand why this did not work correctly, because the final transformation that is applied goes along the lines of:

          final_transform = elec2common/templ2common, i.e. it uses the 'common' coordinate system as an intermediate coordinate system, to match up the template coordinate system with the one in which the electrodes are expressed. As long as this common coordinate system is the same, I would say it doesn't matter which one you take, you could even define the origin on the moon for that matter.
          Yet, I can confirm the wrong result with the default 'ctf', and the better result with the coordsys being 'neuromag' or 'itab'.

          I added an explicit call to ft_determine_coordsys for the elec-array, forcing the user to at least think about it.
