          sourcegrandaverage is ancient. The whole function might have to be reconsidered.

          I do have some (related) good news: git seems to be in a decent state again. So we can probably move forward with the new source structure in a branch. As that is how I would like to address the sourcegrandaverage, i.e. make a new and clean implementation based on a more sane source structure.

Most important is that I removed the old implementation from ft_sourcegrandaverage (there was an explicit old an new section in the code) and that in the \"new\" section I switched to using ft_selectdata_new rather than ft_selectdata_old. The difference between ft_selectdata_new and ft_selectdata_old is that new only selects, whereas old would also concatenate. The concatenation (in case of keepindividual=yes) or averaging (in case keepindividual=no) is now explicitly done in ft_sourcegrandaverage.\n\nMoving both sections of code from old to new indicates that I want this to move forward and that I am willing to take some risks in temporary breaking stuff.

          Just pick the one most convenient for you.

          I suggest you don't paste the link in bugzilla (as you don't want others to access the data) but email it to me directly using r.oostenveld at donders.ru.nl.

          That the avg subfield is gone is part of the design. New source structures should be more similar to timelock and freq structures, and for example to the output of ft_sourcestatistics. That means that the avg and trial subfields have to be removed, the representation "flattened" and dimords better described.

          I have been working on ft_selectdata, but encountered some problems. To address them, I should implement ft_selectdata from scratch (i.e. make a 3rd attempt at the function, after the "old" and the "new" implementation that we now have).

          There is also the related report from Johanna that needs to be addressed with this change. I'll get to work on it tomorrow morning.

          the implementation in ft_sourcegrandaverage is now complete, although there is a regression error according to the reported bug 2544. The updated code is also part of the fieldtrip release.

          You can confirm that it works with the following example code and check the output data structures.

          source = [];
          source.pos = rand(1320,3);
          source.time = 1:25;
          source.avg.pow = rand(10*11*12,25);
          source.inside = 1:660;
          source.outside = 661:1320;

          cfg = [];
          cfg.parameter = 'pow';
          cfg.keepindividual = 'no';
          grandavg1 = ft_sourcegrandaverage(cfg, source, source)

          cfg.keepindividual = 'yes';
          grandavg2 = ft_sourcegrandaverage(cfg, source, source)

          Having completed this specific issue in ft_sourcegrandaverage does not mean that source activity that is expressed as function of time can be used throughout field trip. There is code further down in the analysis pipeline that may need to be further extended.
