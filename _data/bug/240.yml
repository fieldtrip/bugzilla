          When topoplotting with interactive = yes, the channel selection box does not appear.

          Revision r2121 still allows to do this, but the current FT version does not. It is likely to be caused by changes in ft_select_channel.

          Here, ft_selectrange is called with an 'event' keyvalue which is defined at line 65 of ft_select_channel in the current version.

          current version:
          set(gcf, 'WindowButtonDownFcn',   {@ft_select_range, 'multiple', true, 'callback', {@select_channel_multiple, callback}, 'event', event});

          r2121:
          set(gcf, 'WindowButtonMotionFcn', {@ft_select_range, 'multiple', true, 'callback', {@select_channel_multiple, callback}, 'event', 'WindowButtonMotionFcn'});

          At line 65, event is only defined once. This is problematic when multiple event functions are set to the gcf. Therefore, the revision 2122 changes to ft_select_channel are undone for all three gui function settings. An example of one such change:

          set(gcf, 'WindowButtonDownFcn',   {@ft_select_range, 'multiple', true,
          'callback', {@select_channel_multiple, callback}, 'event', event});

          ->

          set(gcf, 'WindowButtonMotionFcn', {@ft_select_range, 'multiple', true,
          'callback', {@select_channel_multiple, callback}, 'event',
          'WindowButtonMotionFcn'});

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
