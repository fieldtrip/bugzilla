        thetext: The plugin currently responsible for the generation of PDF documents is not compatible with many of the dokuwiki features we are using. A more elegant solution to allow users to have nice print versions of our wiki is to provide a decent print stylesheet. This will make PDF rendering obsolete. (Of course, people can still save a print-formatted document to PDF if they want to.)

          Hello folks -

          I'm not sure if this is a known issue, but the "export to pdf" function of the wiki (page tools > "Export as PDF") is seriously broken for code blocks. Attached find the pdf of the page:
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/eventrelatedstatistics

          Check page 3. Note two things:
          - HTML is printed as-is
          - HTML character codes aren't interpreted (i.e., "cfg = &#91;&#93;;" instead of "cfg = [];")

          I assume this is a bug with mediawiki, but I've never worked with it so I can't say for sure. Maybe fiddle with some settings? Update mediawiki? Anyway, this is an awesome functionality, so if it can be made to work better, that would be grand. Thanks -

        thetext: Hi Elli, yes that's right; it's a known issue and actually one of the main reasons we decided to move to a decent print stylesheet which will replace the PDF export function. I have just started work again on the print stylesheet, and I expect it to be finished within a week or two.

          Fixed for now. Known issue: SVG figures do not scale yet very well.

          Let's discuss during the meeeting whether I should remove the PDF functionality.
