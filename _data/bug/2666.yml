        thetext: in the script, sens1 is the original sensor description, and sens2 is created from (a reduced version of) sens1. The assertion then fails because sens2.labelorg is not present. Can .labelorg be excluded from the assertion?

        thetext: It also seems that sens1.label is NOT equal to sens1.labelorg. Maybe that is indicative of an underlying problem?
