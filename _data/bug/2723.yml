        thetext: I was very happy to see this bug just now, as I'd just made these changes for my needs a couple days ago.  Perhaps could someone please test it (against all the test_* functions at Donders) and I'm happy to commit it (or someone else can).

          I just committed your change, with a minor modification. The test script runs fine. I have not run *all* the scripts, but I guess it should be fine. If not, the dashboard will tell us.

          Thank you!
