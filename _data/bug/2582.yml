          I am writing to you to ask some help on the  http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/realtime/micromed issue.

          We are currently running a BCI experiment in the FORTH institute(GR) and until now, we have been using BCI2000 to connect our Micromed64 channel system with fieldtrip buffer.
          I would like to try and replace BCI2000 with  the ft_realtime_micromedproxy function but it seems that I am doing something wrong. Despite of the fact that I have the .p version as released freely and so i cant have access to the source code, I am also having a hard time understanding how the function should be used and could not find any tutorials online. Is there anything that I may have missed?

I think that HASTOOLBOX has changed to an ft_  name as well(I got error messages on those two). The tutorial gives some insight but either way I don't have access to the Micromed system today so I won't be able to check what happens with the different specifications.\n\nI also got this warning:\nWarning: Unloading mex file. Unclosed tcp/udp/ip connections will be closed! \nIs this an aspect of what you mentioned in your last comment about the tcp_udp_ip toolbox?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRegarding hastoolbox: you are right, I missed that one because I had an old hastoolbox somewhere on my path. That is now fixed. \n\nRegarding the unloading mex file: that is harmless. I changed the function a bit so that cleanup is done at the end (i.e. if you press ctrl-C), which means that at the begin you don't see this confusing message any more.\n\nmac011> svn commit\nSending        ft_realtime_micromedproxy.p\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 9543."
