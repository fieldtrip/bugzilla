        thetext: There is apparently no compatibility function for filetype.m even though it has been prefixed. This results in a missing function error when calling low level read functions (like read_neuralynx_ds and such).

          there is fieldtrip/fileio/compat/filetype.m

          however, there were some fileio/private functions that were calling the non-prefixed version. These were also included as file-externals in fieldtrip/private

          In revision 2298 the non-prefixed function calls have been fixed
