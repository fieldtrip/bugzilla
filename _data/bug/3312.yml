          gammaln() should be called instead of lgamma() in external/stats/betapdf.m and compatibility function lgamma.m should be removed. This already took place in Octave from which the function is borrowed:
            http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/rev/653ed3a6ba83
          This prevents the display of a warning in Octave "lgamma shadows a built-in function".

          Hi Guillaume,

          If you want, you can just fork FT on github, pull a clone and make changes in that. If then send a pull-request, we can integrate it more quickly. See http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/git for an explanation (if you need that).

          Robert

          Once lgamma.m is removed, ft_platform_supports.m should be updated not to list this file in 'exclude_mfiles' for 'stats'.
          Also, for compatibility with Octave, the second input argument to has_all_functions_in_dir() should be {} instead of [] (for 'images' and 'signal').
