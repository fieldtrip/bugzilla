          To follow up on the discussion of last Wednesday: The wiki already had a plugin to embed videos into pages.

          I have created a new page that collects all material in an embedded format: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/video

          I have updated the (already existing) faq on this: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/video

          Please have a look...

We should continue linking to existing video material.\n\n\nI don't think there is anything concretely that remains to be done. We should just maintain the video's."
