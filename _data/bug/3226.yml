        thetext: "My script that worked  this morning, stopped working just now. The function ft_preprocessing gives me this weird error, which it did not before. I saw on Github that Robert changed the file ft_preprocessing:\n\n-  hdr = ft_read_header(cfg.headerfile, 'headerformat', cfg.headerformat, 'coordsys', cfg.coordsys, 'coilaccuracy', cfg.coilaccuracy);\n\n+  hdr = ft_read_header(cfg.headerfile, 'headerformat', cfg.headerformat, 'coordsys', cfg.coordsys, 'coilaccuracy', cfg.coilaccuracy, 'checkmaxfilter', istrue(cfg.checkmaxfilter));\n   \nIs it possible that you perhaps overlooked something in your thought process? :) Or would you perhaps have a suggestion for a quick workaround? Thanks!"

        thetext: "what about initializing cfg.checkmaxfilter in ft_read_header, as per \n\ncfg.checkmaxfilter = ft_getopt(cfg, 'checkmaxfilter', false);\n\n@Pim: I suggest to try and fix it yourself, using the recommended procedure on the wiki. This would perhaps help you across the first hurdle to try and contribute things yourself :o).\n\nThe idea would be to create a clone of the fieldtrip github repository in your home-dir, which from then on will be the FT-version you can use on a daily basis.\n\nIf you make changes in that directory, you can push it to your fork on github, and by means of a pull request beneficial changes can end up in the master branch, for everybody to use.\n\nThe recipe is documented here:\n\nhttp://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/git"

          I feel guilty and ambivalent: I Introduced the bug, so I am to blame. But I also agree with JM that it would be good for Pim to use git (as it is soooo easy and fast!)

          In this case I will fix it so that others don't suffer, but will leave a trace to be fixed by Pim...

          I have merged the pull request.

          There is still a line of comment in the code that contains "THIS LINE SHOULD BE REMOVED BY PIM". I will assign the bug to Pim for further fixing.
