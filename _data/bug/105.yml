        thetext: Hi Vladimir, I recall a similar problem with ft_prepare_leadfield. Problems were introduced when somebody in the team built in support for cfg.inputfile/cfg.outputfile. I think I fixed it now for ft_prepare_mesh as well. Could you do a svn-update and report back whether it works? (busy at the moment  with other things, so it would take me too much time to test myself)
