          I updated the pipeline according to the suggestions from the last team meeting.
          I realized from this bug: http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=970
          that there will be 3 node degree maps for each of the dip directions, correct?
          I've attached a figure illustrating the result. I wonder why it deviates so dramatically?

        thetext: after ft_sourceanalysis with pcc you would do ft_sourcedescriptives with projectmom=yes. That projects the source level data along the dipole orientation with maximal variance.

          Yes I tried that, but I got stuck with an error:
          In an assignment  A(I) = B, the number of elements in B and I must be the same.

          Error in ft_sourcedescriptives (line 487)
                  source.avg.pow(i) = powmethodfun(source.avg.csd{i}(dipsel,dipsel));

          need to look it up further.

          In the ft meeting today we discussed:
          * add the possibility to plot 3D spaghetti accidents also in the plotting tutorial as a subheading of "plotting source level data".
          * make several notes throughout the tutorial for instance on the fact that special leakage is a problem more on the sensor level yet present also on source
          * biases of power, trial number etc. on connectivity estimates
          * the icoh producing false positives with signal sources that can be modeled with rotating dipoles such as the heart.
          * end up the tutorial with Summary part and suggested further reading. For instance include Schoffelen et al. HBM.
          * matlab or non FieldTrip code should be avoided- consider the creation of node.node and edge.edge file within existing ft functionality.
          * spoon feed the user by introducing breaks in both code sections and text sections.
          * introduce a section where the motivation behind choosing 'pcc' instead of 'dics'
          is made accessible to the reader. So far there are two instances of 'pcc'- the common filter tutorial and the networkanalysis one.

          * make the motivation behind splitting the data into high and low alpha as accessible to the reader as it gets, i.e. make the analog to eyes open eyes closed where there are two conditions to begin with etc.

          I just moved the zip file on the ftp from pub/fieldtrip to pub/fieldtrip/tutorial.

          Subject_rest should be renamed to SubjectRest (for the ds, hdr and img inside the zip file).
