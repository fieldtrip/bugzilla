        thetext: Once upon a time I contributed to a fieldtripbuffer type of module (c.f. bci2000) in openvibe. I have no idea what the current status of that is. I also don't know what the status is of the openvibe matlabfilter. If both are mature, it might be worthwile to document those in relation to fieldtip, just like bci2000.

          Yep. In the old days when the realtime efforts in fieldtrip were not that mature yet, we sometimes referred to the realtime parts of FT similar to TurboBrainvoyager, which is the realtime version of Brainvoyager.

          Let's discuss this in person.
