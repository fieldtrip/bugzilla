          Error detected in Windows Vista, Matlab R200b, Fieltrip 20120506.

          In read_brainvision_eeg.m after Brainvision data files are read, in the first two file formats (binary, multiplexed, with Binary Format int_16 or int_32) the following code is used:

          (Lines 38-39 and 48-49)
          % compute real microvolts using the calibration factor (resolution)
            res = sparse(diag(hdr.resolution));
            dat = res * dat;

          When long files are opened, this tends to produce an Out of memory error in the last instruction, as it tries to multiply in a single operation. Changing the code so that the multiplication takes place for each channel separately is not as fast, but it is more memory efficient.
          A solution is proposed below, nonetheless, it is still way more inefficient when it comes to memory use that pop_loadvb from EEGLAB, at least for the file formats mentioned before.

          Suggested code improvement:

          % compute real microvolts using the calibration factor (resolution)
          res = sparse(diag(hdr.resolution));
          try
            dat = res * dat;
          catch ME
            if strcmp (ME.identifier,'MATLAB:nomem')
              for ChannelToMultiply = 1:size(dat,1)
                dat (ChannelToMultiply,:) = dat (ChannelToMultiply,:) * hdr.resolution(ChannelToMultiply);
              end;
            end;
          end;

          Hi!

          It can work too, it seems to be a nice solution. However, I don't understand why it is better to use diagonal matrix res instead of hdr.resolution, it should be more efficient (unless there is a specific reason I don't know about).

          The code would then be:

          for CurrentColumn = 1:size(dat,2)
             dat(:,CurrentColumn)=hdr.resolution*dat(:,CurrentColumn);
          end

          Hi Joaquin, sorry for not having addressed this one. It kind of escaped our attention. Would your analysis still benefit from a change in the code? If so, I'll change it, but could I then ask you to test it?

          Thanks,

          Jan-Mathijs

          Hi Jan!

          I've already changed it in my own copy of Fieldtrip, so I don't need it per se, but I think it would be an improvement of the code and useful for other users. I'd gladly test any code change and report back. Thanks!

        thetext: changed in revision 6293. I think it works OK, but I would appreciate if you update your FT-version and test it, to see whether it works as expected.
