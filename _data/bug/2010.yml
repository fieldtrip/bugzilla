          I noticed a retweet of an email from Rodrigo. The mex file is still missing. Since maintaining 32 bit mex files in the future might be more often problematic, we should try to make the code more robust against mex files missing. In this case it is not part of a crucial computation and an alternative is possible.

          mac011> cd fieldtrip
          mac011> find . -name CalcMD5\*
          ./external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.c
          ./external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.COPYING
          ./external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.m
          ./external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.mexa64
          ./external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.mexglx
          ./external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.mexmaci64
          ./external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.mexw32
          ./external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.mexw64

          I don't have a 32 bit OSX machine any more. @Eelke, do you still have the mex file? If not, we can ask Rodrigo (CC) to cd into fieldtrip/external/fileexchange and type "mex -setup; mex CalcMD5.c"

          I have installed MATLAB2009b 32-bit on my MacBook with OS X 10.9.2 Mavericks. It was a bit of a hassle to get it working with the mex compiler, but with some tweaks to mexopts.sh and following http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22367516/mex-compile-error-unknown-type-name-char16-t it appears to work.

          I ran ft_compile_mex: a number of mex files were recompiled and the missing mex file was created.

          It is possible to download the latest version of field trip, which includes the new mex file. As an alternative, you can also download only the mex file from https://fieldtrip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/external/fileexchange/CalcMD5.mexmaci and add it to your field trip/external/fileexchange directory.

          I hope this resolves it.
