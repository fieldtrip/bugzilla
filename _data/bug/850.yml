        thetext: "I filed this one myself, but cannot remember what was the problem. I suspect this has to do with the conversion between different representations of the spectral data, e.g. from fourier to powerspectra. Probably, the operation cumsum(freq.cumtapcnt) gives problems when the cumtapcnt field is a matrix rather than a vector. \nHowever, since I don't know how to reproduce the problem here, I'll put it to wontfix"
