          First of all, we have weekly FT development meetings, at 13:00 in room
          1.153 of the Trigon. During these, we discuss ongoing practical and
          development issues.

          Second, it's important that you get access to the code, so you can
          actually contribute. Robert will create accounts for you on our SVN
          server. After that's done, see
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/svn for instructions on how
          to set up SVN. We strongly recommend using the Linux (command-line)
          interface to SVN, and to avoid the Windows client.

          Third, if you aren't registered already, you should register for the
          main FieldTrip e-mail list:
          http://mailman.science.ru.nl/mailman/listinfo/fieldtrip Take care that
          you register using the e-mail address you intend to send mail *from*.
          (E.g. mail sent to your @fcdonders address will probably end up in the
          proper inbox, but if you register that one and then try to post from
          @donders, it will fail.)

          I think those are the most important practical things for now. Are
          both of you able to attend the weekly FT meetings? If so, let's meet
          next week Monday 26 Jan at 13:00, and the three of us can then
          continue the practical intro after the meeting.

          In case of questions, of course just let me know.

          I will send the passwords (which are not linked to mental) by email. Please see http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/svn for instructions how to change your password, or even beter would be to exchange ssh keys.

          I added them to /fieldtrip-github-svn/.git/authors.txt on the svn server (for synching svn to Github). I also added a search for them to the bugzilla footer.

          At the moment I cannot think of additional things that need to be arranged. They both have their first bug assigned: bug 2822 and bug 2823.
