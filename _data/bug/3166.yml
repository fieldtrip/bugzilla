          Created attachment 803
          Problematic file example

          We have an SPM user who upgraded her system and started having problem with triggers in ASA eep_cnt format. I managed to trace it down to a change that was done around last November in ft_read_event. It looks like it was Sarang:

          % $Id: ft_read_event.m 10934 2015-11-23 20:34:33Z sardal $

          Prior to that the event samples were computed from trg.time . Sarang changed it to trg.offset . I have no idea why but the offset column in those files doesn't make any sense. The numbers are huge and when divided by the sampling rate (2400) don't match the times at all. I attach an example. For now I sent this lady the old version of the code. But this is probably something that should be fixed.

          Seems there might be a mex file conflict, see bug 2907. This code was updated to handle a newer version of the ASA file format, and (if the appropriate mex-files are in place) should handle both the new and old formats. Please reopen bug 2907 if this is still a problem.

          (In reply to Sarang Dalal from comment #1)
           I don't see how this can have to do with the mex file. There is no mex file for read_eep_trg in our version. Also you can see the numbers in the text file. The code reads them correctly, it's the numbers that are wrong.

          read_eeg_trp.m is invalid (breaks for newer ASA data), and read_eeg_trp.mex must be used to support both formats. Note that the code in read_eeg_trp.mex does not appear to match read_eeg_trp.m

          See comment 7 of the other bug for the details

          I see. You are right. We should update our eeprobe.

          Thanks,
