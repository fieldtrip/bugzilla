          added to neighbourselection in template mode a remark to contact me in case of error

          updated neighbourselection help text

          created templates for all data types from test data and for all layouts that don't suffer from the sens.tra bug.

          all templates are not optimized yet, but are reasonable neighbourstructures

          note for myself to easen the work on this task:
          - add a cfg.edit (or enableedit) option to ft_neighbourplot

          if in editmode
          - clicking on two channels right after each other makes or removes (toggle) these channels as neighbours
          - add a button for undoing the last step

          ft_neighbourplot now supports cfg.enableedit, which allows the user to add or remove edges between nodes, i.e. mark or unmark sensors as being neighbours. Primarily, this one is for me to make my life working on this bug easier, but it will also help people to tinker their own neighbour structure

          - beautified + enhanced all templates based on the 2D layouts, for anyone to pick up on this in a few years from now: rationale is that squares+diagonals should be preferred over triangles. Occasionally, when it makes sense i.e. sensors are closeby and would have few connections, a pentagram like connection is allowed.
           - next step: use 3D MEG testdata to verify whether the templates make sense in 3D space as well
