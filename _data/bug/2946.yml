          Hi Todor,

          FieldTrip will not automatically add fieldtrip/external/besa/matlab2besa to the path, that only works in ft_hastoolbox for directories at the level of fieldtrip/external/xxx itself.


          Why not move the files one directory up and extend the README a bit?

          Hi Robert,
          I removed the folder matlab2besa and moved the files one folder up.
          As next I am going to test the script fieldtrip2besa.m.

          I tested the script fieldtrip2besa a bit and i found some problems:

          1. The variable custom_path is not defined, however, the exporting functions need that variable in order to know where to save the files. One option would be to define the variable like this:

          % Get the current path. The files are going to be exported here.
          custom_path = pwd();

          or to add a new input parameter to the function fieldtrip2besa.

          2. In the case of data resulted from "ft_preprocessing" the single trials are stored in a cell array of matrices and the call of squeeze(...) does not work in the switch case "raw". The solution would be to call squeeze like this:

          data_matrix = squeeze(data.trial{iTr});

          3. All the sensor level values are multiplied by 1e15 in order to get the values in femto Tesla, however, this is only valid for MEG data. Maybe it would be better to remove that constant or to make difference between MEG and EEG and multiply by 1e15 only in the case of MEG.

          4. I was not able to run the export of an ".elp" file. The following error was generated:

          >> fieldtrip2besa('filename_elp', timelock_cond1.grad, timelock_cond1.label)
          Error using ft_getopt
          the first input should contain key-value pairs

          Error in fieldtrip2besa (line 26)
          channel = ft_getopt(varargin, 'channel');

          5. In the example I used to write the documentation one channel was defined as bad and in the script one channel is removed. See:

          NumBadChannels = 1; % A106

          This should not be used in fieldtrip2besa since in all cases one channel is going to be removed by the export of the elp-file. Alternatively, one can define some kind of input parameter for the bad channels.

          I tried to make the changes by myself but I do not have access to change files outside of external/besa.
