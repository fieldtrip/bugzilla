          please add attachment.

          so far I have never encountered problems.

          did you use connectivityanalysis?

          I had some problems with that so I moved the plot_bug.mat to ~/common/temporary/laumar. I hope that will work!

          for me stat_coh_full works -> cfg.refchannel should not be numeric, but the label of the channel (I guess in this case 'fastica004'

          stat_coh has strange dimensionality in the functional data, shouldn't this be reshaped to begin with?

          did you have a look at ft_connectivityplot? currently it does not support TF-data, but it is relatively straightforward to extend the functionality there

        thetext: for the stat_coh variable, it's the ft_prepare_layout function which fails -> it can not deal with an absent label-field (because there's only labelcmb in the data).

          Regarding reshaping: you are right, but that does not make a difference for the bugs presence.

          Regarding the numeric cfg.channel, that is according to the specification of FT_CHANNELSELECTION -> fix needed.

          Regarding sparse/full representation, that is something that the FT function should handle -> fix needed?

          Regarding the absence of stat_coh.label, that is something that the FT function should handle -> fix needed.

          The input structure, either sparse (after some reshaping) or full, is a technically correct description of a T data structure and hence it should work. If the data structure is not supported, then ft_checkdata should inform the user. Right now ft_checkdata and ft_datatype both don't complain.

          The issue with the numeric cfg.refchannel is now fixed.

          Wrt to the other problem, my suspicion is that the fix is needed in ft_prepare_layout

          I created a test script and copied the data (reshaped) to home/common. See

          and
