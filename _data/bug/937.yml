          At the moment, ft_prepare_mesh works by first having the user do something like this (modified from Cristiano's recent email to the List):
          % read in the mri
          mri = ft_read_mri('Subject01.mri');
          % segment it
          cfg = [];
          cfg.output = {'scalp', 'skull', 'brain'};
          seg = ft_volumesegment(cfg, mri);
          % assign a label
          scalp = (seg.scalp) & ~(seg.skull | seg.brain);
          skull = 2*(seg.skull);
          brain = 3*(seg.brain);
          seg.seg = scalp + skull + brain; % this line is different than in the email

          Then calling ft_prepare_mesh such as:
          cfg             = [];
          cfg.method      = 'segmentation';
          cfg.tissue      = [1 2 3]; % scalp = 1; skull = 2; brain = 3;
          cfg.numvertices = [2000 1000 800];
          cfg.sourceunits = 'mm';
          cfg.mriunits    = 'mm';
          bnd = ft_prepare_mesh(cfg, seg);

          1) However, this does not work at the moment because, as suggested by a user on the list, line 25 of prepare_mesh_segmentation must be commented out so that cfg.tissue is not set to 1.  I have fixed this for now by removing that line (with Cristiano's recommendation), but perhaps consider:

          2) I think it would be better if the part under '%assign a label' was incorporated into ft_prepare_mesh, and instead the user specifies which segments to use, for example cfg.segment={'scalp' 'skull' 'brain'} (or a subset) rather than cfg.tissue = [1 2 3].

          2a) therefore seg.seg should not be a required subfield

          3) cfg.method (in documentation) is not actually called by the code, and should be replaced by documenting cfg.interactive ('yes' calls 'manual', otherwise 'segmentation' or other options are used).  (I've fixed this).

          4) contrary to documentation, an un-segmented MRI does not work as input.  The '.seg' field is required regardless.  I have updated the 'example' at the end of documetation to reflect the current implementation.  However, a more thorough check of all the cfg options with the documentation is still needed.

It is fixed now (svn 6598) \n\nexcept:\n\nBug in ft_voltype.m, introduced svn r5288.  Current lines 105-106 fail:\nelseif isfield(vol, 'bnd') && strcmp(type, {'dipoli', 'asa', 'bemcp', 'openmeeg'})\n  type = any(strcmp(type, {'dipoli', 'asa', 'bemcp', 'openmeeg'}));\n\nSince 'type' does not exist.  I realise the logic here is that it should only be give type='bem' if one of specific bem-types, but then A) how to detect that it is one of 4 BEM-types and not already taken care of by vol.type earlier in code? or B) what to do with input that indeed has vol.bnd but is not a BEM?"

          bug 1756 resolved and updated ft_voltype in svn commit 6671.
          Also updated this test function to better relfect what is desired (and removed some examples that made less sense).
