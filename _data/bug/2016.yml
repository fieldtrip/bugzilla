        thetext: "Choosing lambda in the lcmv beamformer is an important issue and can dramatically change the results.\n\nTo show this, I used a simple auditory paradigm in which a trains of beeps were presented to the left ear of a participant. The system is neuromag306 and the data has been maxfiltered which reduces the rank of the data from 306 to 64. Please see the attached images for the results:\n\nImage lamPst5_lamPre5.jpg is for when the lambda for both pre and post-stimulus has been set to cfg.lambda = '5%'. The results are clearly wrong.\n\nImage lamPst5_lamPre1000.jpg is for when the lambda for pre- and post-stimulus has been set to '5%' and '1000%', respectively. The result shows some genuine activity. This means assuming noise is white Gaussian gives better results.\n\nImage lamPst5_lamPre1000.jpg is for when the lambda for pre- and post-stimulus has been set to '1000%' and '1000%', respectively. The result is the best in this situation.\n\nBased on this example and my experiment, I have some suggestions:\n\n-- It should be clearly stated in the documentation that the value of regularisation has big impact on the results. \n\n-- Instead of estimating the noise covariance from the pre-stim segment, it is better to assume that the noise is white Gaussian. Of course this does not always give the best results, but it surely gives more robust results. Therefore, this should be the default implementation of the code and general user should select this.\n\n-- last and least, there is no need to:\n\nsourceDiff.avg.pow = (sourcePost_con.avg.pow - sourcePre_con.avg.pow) ./ sourcePre_con.avg.pow;\n\nsince it is equivalent to \n\nsourceDiff.avg.pow = sourcePost_con.avg.pow ./ sourcePre_con.avg.pow - 1;\n\nwhich is a biased version of the neural activity index."

It might also explain how to come up with the absolute nomber (although I suspect most people to use the percent version). And it could show a sequence of figures going from no (i.e. too little) to too much regularization.\n\n@Hamid, would you be willing to contribute such a faq page to the wiki? You can use your own figures in the demonstration."

          I general the code is very well written, but my point is we should make clear that regularisation and normalisation are important issues in source localisation, and the general user should be aware of these problems. Otherwise, if someone try to localise a big auditory ERF and don't see the results (e.g. with lambda = 1% and 5%), s/he may get disappointed.

          I would be happy to write a FAQ with results from different lambda.

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #3)\n\nThanks for the input. We try to organize documentation at various levels:\n\n1) there are comments in the code (not really accessible for most people)\n2) there is help at the function start, this is the reference documentation. Should be complete and correct, does not allow for elaborating too much.\n3) there is the wiki with\n  a) the FAQs, can be short or long, pertain to one topic\n  b) the example scripts, should be more substantial, should demonstrate\n  c) the tutorials, should allow users to try it out themselves\n\nThe tutorials are used for teaching (~6-8 workshops this year). The format should allow for a 2-hour hands-on session with exercises. So they cannot get too elaborate and cannot include \"reference\" details. They should point to further reading, elsewhere on the wiki and in papers. \n\nIn this case it would fit well in the format of a faq, or the format of an example script. With the appropriate tags, they can be found. Some tutorials include auto-generated lists of related material, some have hand-crafted lists. In this case it would make sense to link to the new page that details regularization in the http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/beamformer#summary section. Keeping it in the exercise 6 means that people also discover it themselves (by trying out)."
