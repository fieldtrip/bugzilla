        thetext: "Created attachment 7\nstat structure causing problems\n\nHi Jan-Mathijs,\n\nThanks for the advise, and I apologize for sending a file to your account, but I' having a hard time sending data to ftp://..../incoming/ folder. It complains that the folder cannot be modified. \n\nAttachment m-file contains \"stat\" that I made. Following your email, I corrected the typo, and it gives another error. It cannot find \"labelcmb\" in stat, which should be formatted in checkdata.m . \n\nI'm using fieldtrip-20100121 version. \n\nThank you for your help, Akiko\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: jan-mathijs schoffelen <jan.schoffelen@DONDERS.RU.NL>\nDate: Monday, October 11, 2010 3:17 am\nSubject: Re: [FIELDTRIP] plotting plv\nTo: FIELDTRIP@NIC.SURFNET.NL\n\nDear Akiko,\n\nA small comment first: there's a type in the naming of your zparam  \n'cohsprctm' should probably read 'cohspctrm', but I don't think that  \n\nthis is the show stopper. Next, I guess that given your configuration  \n\nfor ft_freqanalysis, the eventual output of ft_connectivityanalysis is \n\na 3x3xNfreqxNtime - matrix containing plv-values. Is that correct?\nI do not understand why the visualization fails, but it seems that the \n\ncorrect part of the code is not reached.\nCould you save the variable 'stat' to a file and upload it to our ftp- \n\nserver, so that we can reproduce your bug. Recently we spent quite  \nsome time in streamlining the visualisation for this type of data and  \n\nI am pretty sure that in your case it just should work. Please have a  \n\nlook at \nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_should_i_send_example_data_to_the_developers \n\n to upload your data.\n\nBest,\n\nJan-Mathijs\n\nOn Oct 11, 2010, at 12:54 AM, Akiko Ikkai wrote:\n\nHi,\n\nI'm trying to plot plv between channel pairs that I get from  \nft_connectivityanalysis.\n\nwhen I run\ncfg                  = [];\ncfg.xparam           = 'time';\ncfg.yparam           = 'freq';\ncfg.zparam           = 'cohsprctm';  % need to run stat.cohsprctm =  \n\nstat.plvspctrm;\n                                                % fixed in the  \nlatest version?\ncfg.cohrefchannel    = '1';\ncfg.layout = 'ordered';\ncfg.showlabels       = 'yes';\ncfg.colorbar         = 'yes';\nfigure; ft_multiplotTFR(cfg, stat)\n\nI get this error:\nft_multiplotTFR(cfg, stat)\n???

        thetext: "Dear Akiko,\n\nI tried to reproduce the bug as you got it. I was not able to do so (although I ran into a few other issues). \nPlease first update to the most recent version of FieldTrip.\nThis should solve your initial problem.\n\nSecond, the visualization does not work, because there is only a very sparse subset of channel pairs in the stat-structure. This seems to be confusing to ft_multiplotTFR, and is something which should be fixed. Yet, for the time being, why don't you have a look at the plv-spectra 'by hand'. In the end it's only 3 unique channel pairs we are talking about.\n\nThis can be done as follows:\n\nfigure;imagesc(stat.time,stat.freq,squeeze(stat.plvspctrm(1,2,:)));axis xy;\nfigure;imagesc(stat.time,stat.freq,squeeze(stat.plvspctrm(1,3,:)));axis xy;\nfigure;imagesc(stat.time,stat.freq,squeeze(stat.plvspctrm(2,3,:)));axis xy;"
