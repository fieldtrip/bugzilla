          % FT_CONNECTIVITYPLOT plots frequency domain connectivity with dimord
          % 'chan_chan_freq'. The data are rendered in a square grid of subplots
          % and each subplot containing the spectrum.

          But it would be trivial to have it also allow dimord=chan_chan_freq, and reasonably simple to implement it for dimord=chan_chan_freq_time

        thetext: PR 293 implements TFR plotting. Since FT does not yet produce time only connectivity metrics, I'll leave the chan_chan_time untouched for now (actually now it throws an explicit error). Code currently contains some placeholders to implement it. It may even already work if the error is removed.
