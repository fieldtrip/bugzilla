          I don't know whether others can also do that, or whether I am the only one because of the administrative rights for my account.

          The approach I take is
          do a search
          save search as "johzum"
          go to "preferences" -> "saved searches" tab
          change the settings for johzum to "share with editbugs" and "show in footer"

          Johanna now has her own quick link in the footer.

        thetext: I followed your instructions to re-create the saved-search.  It appears to have worked on my account, but I don't know if it appears correctly for others.
