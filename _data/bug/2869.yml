          Why are the signals from '-HEOG1','-HEOG2','-IO','-65' channels change after average referencing, which excludes all non-EEG channels?
          cfg=[];
          cfg.reref         = 'yes' ;
          cfg.refchannel    = {'all','-HEOG1','-HEOG2','-IO','-65'};
          data_out        = ft_preprocessing(cfg,data_for_reref);

          Dear Ekaterina,

          If I am not mistaken cfg.refchannel only specifies the channels that are supposed to be the reference. Cfg.channel specifies to which channels the rereferencing should be applied. In your example you are calculating the average reference over all channels except for the ones you excluded and applying the new referencing scheme to all channels.

          This means that if I want to use one matrix for EEG and EOG data and make reference, first I need to divide and then combine the data
          (because if I define the options cfg.channel and cfg.refchannel I will get on the output only EEG channels)

          yes, that is also how it is explained on for example

          http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/eeg_preprocessing_erp#extracting_the_eog_signals
          and

          I think that Irina (who wrote the tutorial) did this because she does not like to include these two very low channels close to the eyes in the subsequent EEG analysis. But that choice is up to you. The tutorial just shows one way that it can be done.
