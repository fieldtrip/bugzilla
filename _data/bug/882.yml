          I have created a shell script which is executed automatically every 10 minutes which
          1) updates the svn figures from the wiki to home/common
          2) updates the svn figures from home/common to the wiki

          if you update the figure on home/common, it should overwrite the one on the wiki.

          I have not yet tested it, but you can try it out: the figures are on /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/wiki/media and match the page/directory layout of the wiki.

          > @Lilla: please give it a try

          hi Robert,

          I have tried it. When I copy a file to home/common it will appear also in the media browser of the fieldtrip site. It hasn't copy a file, however, that was called home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/wiki/media/trf_pipeline2 copy.svg. Is it because it is a copy of an other file with the same name (there is also a file called tfr_pipeline2)?

          And I can't delete files neither from home/common or from the website.

          Lilla

          the space in the filename might be an issue.

          Deleting on either side is indeed not implemented. If you delete on one side, the file will be recreated by the sync. The only way to get rid of a file is to delete it on both sides simultaneously.

        thetext: 'Regarding SVG figures on wiki: My latest information is that when an svg file is uploaded the font-types are changing to a "default" which looks quite ugly. I do not know if this is still a problem, but an alternative solution is to upload figures in two versions (svg and png) and letting the png to appear on the website.'

          Can I add this latest comment (= If you experience difficulties with the appearance of the svg files on the wiki, you can upload the figure in svg and also in png format, and insert png to the website) to the documentation guidelines?

          The person uploading might not see the ugly font, whereas someone else does. So I don't think that these instructions to the uploader would help.

          I have a script running regularly that does

          SRC=roboos@fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl:/var/www/fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/data/media/
          DEST=/home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/wiki/media/
          chmod -R 777 $DEST
          rsync -vaurP --include="*.svg" --include="*.jpg" --include="*.png" --exclude="*.*" $SRC $DEST
          rsync -vaurP --include="*.svg" --include="*.jpg" --include="*.png" --exclude="*.*" $DEST $SRC


          i.e. copy the media files between the wiki server and the  /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/wiki/media/ directory. In that home/common directory you can quickly update a figure (i.e. crop the bitmaps, or make some other small change). The figure will them be copied back to the wiki.
