        thetext: "Hi, \n\nWhen I use \"ft_artifact_zvalue\" from version 20130512 I encounter the following error message: \n\n\"Error using ft_fetch_data (line 123)\nsome of the requested samples occur twice in the data\n\nError in ft_artifact_zvalue (line 262)\n      dat{trlop} = ft_fetch_data(data,        'header', hdr, 'begsample', trl(trlop,1)-fltpadding, 'endsample',\n      trl(trlop,2)+fltpadding, 'chanindx', sgnind, 'checkboundary', strcmp(cfg.continuous,'no\nError in SFC_preprocessing (line 121)\n    [zcfgART, artifact] = ft_artifact_zvalue(zcfg,data);\"\n\n\n\nTo fix this, I have changed the line  40 in ft_fetch_data from \"allowoverlap  = ft_getopt(varargin, 'allowoverlap', false);\" to \"allowoverlap  = ft_getopt(varargin, 'allowoverlap', true);\". This fixes the error message. I was wondering if the change I have made in ft_fetch_data will affect the performance of other fieldtrip functions.\n\nThanks a lot for your time.\n\nBest regards,\nSahand"

        thetext: "Dear Sahar\n\nWhat makes you think it is an error in the code?\n\nThe error that you are seeing suggests that you have overlapping data segments, i.e. the same piece of data happens in trial N and in trial N+1. That is a situation with which ft_artifact_zvalue cannot deal with as the same piece of data cannot be checked twice for artifacts. \n\nPlease check what is in your data.sampleinfo, and specifically if there is overlap between subsequent trials. Something that may help is to plot it like this\n\nfigure\nhold on\nfor i=1:size(data.sampleinfo,1)\n  begsample = data.sampleinfo(i,1);\n  endsample = data.sampleinfo(i,2);\n  numsample = endsample-begsample+1;\n  plot(begsample:endsample, ones(1,nsample)*i, '.')\nend\n\nit results in a staircase-like figure where the stairs should not be overlapping. \n\nIf the problem is indeed in the overlapping trials, it is not a bug but an intended feature of the code and you should solve the problem in your data representation.\n\nbest regards\nRobert"

          Thanks a lot Robert. Actually, there is overlap in the data and I should fix that.

          Best regards,
          Sahand
