          I changed /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp to reflect the whole ftp layout, i.e. /pub/fieldtrip.

          there is now a cron job running (every 2 hours) that synchronizes /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp with a specific network disk that is made visible as /pub/fieldtrip on the ftp server. That cron job also removes old files from the ftp, i.e. files that were removed from home/common.

          Writing to the ftp site is not recommended. The fieldtrip-xxx.zip release files are also handled through the cron job and are from now also not directly written to the ftp server.
