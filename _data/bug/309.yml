          If it's not a bug it must be a feature :-)

          FYI, I just ran peercellfun('exp',{2}, 'timreq',0.1) again and it hasn't finished yet (after more than 20 resubmissions and 10 minutes elapsed time)...

        thetext: "The bug/feature has been there from the beginning and is a design consequence of the command-line peerslaves. If there are no licenses available, the peerslaves cannot start an engine and teh job cannot be executed. \n\nIt would be a bug if the job would eventually not execute, but there is never a guarantee that peercellfun will actually speed up the job. \n\nCompeting users (in this case one with many big jobs and another with a single small job) the single job has a disadvantage. Had the single job been bigger, it would not have been different. \n\nThe disappointing performance (and frequent resubmissions every 30 seconds) have to do with the many peerslaves that cannot get a license but are still running. \n\nWhat do you suggest to solve the problem?"

          increase zombietimeout in peerslave.exe to 900 seconds (15 minutes)
          peerslave.exe returns an error if the matlab engine fails to start
          peerslave catches the error and resubmits immediately (used to take 30 seconds)
