          I figured I'd make a bug instead of an email, just to keep the info about the bug central.

          It turns out that matlab's rename() is not an atomic operation, as I found out after some googling. Also movefile() would not do the trick. So, I'll now implement the renaming by a system()-call to the rename-command, which will hopefully help.

          This seems to do the trick. I will do some more testing to make sure.

          One more note: the walltime option seems to impose quite a strict limit on the computation time. I noted a few jobs that were killed because they lasted 47s (as evident from the stderr output file), while timreq was 30.

          I was not aware that jobs were already killed in the current torque configuration. Something to look into...
