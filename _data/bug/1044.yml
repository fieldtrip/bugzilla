        thetext: it seems that single trial noise covariances are supported -> with rawtrial. As such this does not really make sense.

          I suggest to change ft_sourceanalysis such that it works the same way for the pcc/dics/lcmv and for the mne.

          This entails the support for keeping filters in mne, and allowing for cfg.singletrial to be activated for mne. In this context, pre-computed filters (based on the average noise covariance) need to be in the input.
          This entails also support for using precomputed filters in mne

        thetext: "implemented with revision 5066. \n\nThe logic for mne is now the same as with the beamformers: first compute the spatial filters using the average, and then reconstruct the single trials using the pre-computed filters in cfg.grid.filter = source.avg.filter, and cfg.rawtrial = 'yes';"

          Great! This is now the same as the method described for DICS:
