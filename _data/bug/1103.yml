          Dear Johannes,

          Yes, this is a bug in FT, the only thing I don't get is how it has worked until now. In ft_sourceinterpolate the default interpmethod is 'linear' but it is not one of the method supported by the interpolation function interp_ungridded.

          Vladimir

          I'm testing the beamformer code you have sent him a while ago.
          Unfortunately the "code crashes" at line 426 calling ft_sourceinterpolate:

          ??? Error using ==> interp_ungridded at 130
          unsupported projection method

          Error in ==> ft_sourceinterpolate at 221
            interpmat = interp_ungridded(functional.pos, warp_apply(anatomical.transform, [X(:) Y(:) Z(:)]), ...

        thetext: The original default (when ft_sourceinterpolate still only supported 3D -> 3D interpolation) interpolation method was linear. When doing more exotic interpolations, the function relies on interp_ungridded, which does not support linear as a method. I now made the default specific for each situation (by postponing the definition of the default until the specific situation has been determined).
