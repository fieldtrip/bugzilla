          Currently many of tests in FT's test directory contain a reference to dccnpath; according to a recent count I did, 345 use dccnpath and 249 do not.

          I wonder if the test files (or at least a subset - no idea how big they are) could be made available to the general public so that they can be used for testing. (For a recent effort see https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/310). It would allow developers outside the DCCN to be able to run and test their code in a similar way as those inside.

          Robert Oostenveld replied on GitHub [1]:

          "the test data files comprise 157G on our network file system at /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test. That is not all, since some tests use files from the tutorials and example scripts, which are at /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp. Together with some unzipped version of the tutorial data (which are in ./data itself) the whole data is 224G. Sharing this is problematic due to its size, but also since not all data has been explicitly cleared for sharing/redistribution. Partial sharing might work, but synchronizing and versioning the test data is not simple."
