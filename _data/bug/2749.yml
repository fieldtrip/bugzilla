        thetext: "When the input data has a field 'cohspctrm' the function fails on line 162 because it loops over 'param'. Yet param has field 'inside' 'cohspctrm' and 'pos' but at that stage only the 'inside' part is actually relevant because the others are computed below. \n\non line 151 I added this:\n----------\nind=find(ismember(param,'inside'));% find the index of 'inside' field\n  % because its position varies with isfield('plvspctrm') vs. 'cohspctrm'\n  param      = param(sel(ind));\n----------\nso that param at that stage is always 'inside'.\n\nAny objections?"

          I think that ft_source2full and source2sparse have to be fully revamped, consistently making use of the new style but now also using getdimord.

          However, for the moment I am fine with your change.

          How would I commit the change since it is not under version control?

          bash-4.1$ svn commit ft_source2full.m -m 'bugfix- ft_source2full added explicit care for the field 'inside' see http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=2749'
          svn: Commit failed (details follow):
          svn: '/home/electromag/tzvpop/fieldtrip/ft_source2full.m' is not under version control

          It seems that you moved the file around. It should be located in fieldtrip/utilities.
