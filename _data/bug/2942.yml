          I followed the tutorial on

          http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/eventrelatedstatistics?s[]=cluster&s[]=permutation

          at the very end, I wanted to do the ft_clusterplot but then I did not get topoplots as a function of time as in the
          tutorial and instead just got one plot.

          Is there something wrong in the way the parameters are set in the tutorial.
          The last part is as follows:

          % make a plot
          cfg = [];
          cfg.highlightsymbolseries = ['*','*','.','.','.'];
          cfg.layout = 'CTF151.lay';
          cfg.contournum = 0;
          cfg.markersymbol = '.';
          cfg.alpha = 0.05;
          cfg.parameter='stat';
          cfg.zlim<http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/zlim.html> = [-5 5];
          ft_clusterplot(cfg,stat);

          Any input will be very helpful.

          Thanks.

I have fixed it (see https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=10603), it now supports chan, chan_time, chan_freq and chan_freq_time (but only if either time or freq has length 1). The fixed version is available from github or svn, or this evening on ftp. \n\n\nOn 07 Aug 2015, at 16:43, Stephen Politzer-Ahles wrote:\n\nAlso, is it just me or is http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/eventrelatedstatistics#permutation_test_based_on_cluster_statistics essentially duplicating (with what looks like a more recent example and code) what's in http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/cluster_permutation_timelock ? Would it be worthwhile to reconcile these two (and maybe replace one with a link to the other, so they don't get out of sync again)?\n\nContent-wise they are similar, but we use the eventrelatedstatistics tutorial in training settings (e.g. workshops) as gentle introduction into statistics in general with only towards the end the clustering, whereas cluster_permutation_timelock goes more in depth. So they serve different goals. Since the code should now be working again for the 1st, I hope it also works for the 2nd.\n\nbest regards,\nRobert"
