          Hi Eric,

          I think ft_freqanalysis should work when the input data does not have an fsample field. The sampling rate is implicitly represented in the time axis. E.g., the following works fine for me:

          data = [];
          data.label = {'a'};
          data.time = {0.001:0.001:1};
          data.trial = {randn(1,1000)};

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method = 'mtmfft';
          cfg.taper = 'hanning';
          freq = ft_freqanalysis(cfg, data);

          Does this example give an error on your end?

          Having said that, I do agree that it would be good to copy over fsample. We have had a few discussions about this in the FT meeting, and the general opinion was that fsample should be deprecated/removed, as the same info is represented in the time axis. However, as the time axis occasionally is not exactly spaced with a rational number (because of floating point blabla), fsample in my opinion does give a convenient bit of extra information. Therefore I have tended to disagree with this general opinion :)

          I suspect the change was made in r9336 (https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/diff?spec=svn9336&r=9336&format=side&path=/trunk/ft_appenddata.m) by Robert (adding as cc); at line 225 in that revision now the output argument is explicitly initialized as []. Previously I guess the fsample was implicitly carried over from  one of the input arguments. Robert, should we add 'fsample' to the 'copyfield' array (line 298)? I would find it convenient, but it would not be in line with deprecating fsample of course.

          The following functions seem still to be using data.fsample

          mac011> grep -l =.*\\.fsample *.m
          fieldtrip2fiff.m
          ft_appenddata.m
          ft_artifact_ecg.m
          ft_artifact_tms.m
          ft_componentanalysis.m
          ft_connectivityanalysis.m
          ft_connectivitysimulation.m
          ft_databrowser.m
          ft_dipolesimulation.m
          ft_freqanalysis.m
          ft_freqanalysis_mvar.m
          ft_freqsimulation.m
          ft_interpolatenan.m
          ft_megrealign.m
          ft_mvaranalysis.m
          ft_preprocessing.m
          ft_redefinetrial.m
          ft_rejectartifact.m
          ft_rejectcomponent.m
          ft_removetmsartifact.m
          ft_resampledata.m
          ft_timelockanalysis.m

          All functions should pass the input data through ft_checkdata, which presently will still always ensure that data.fsample is present (see line 142 of ft_datatype_raw, which si called by ft_checkdata). I.e. FieldTrip is still quite lenient with the use of data.fsample. In the future (if someone has time to go over all the code), data.fsample will not be used anymore in the FT code and it will permanently be removed from the raw data structure.
