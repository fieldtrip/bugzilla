          The user of this application should have the possibility to toggle between multiple visualization options. Some are mutually exclusive, some are additive.

          - show schematic/realistic head
          - show dewar yes/no
          - show gradiometer coils yes/no
          - show mirror view yes/no

          The following code does not result in the expected visualization. This relates to test_bug3375.m and http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3375.
          It seems that not all data objects are expressed in the same coordinate system.
          cd(dccnpath('/home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/bug3375'));

          cfg = [];
          cfg.dataset = 'elekta/jn_multimodal_chpi_raw_sss.fif';
          cfg.bufferdata = 'first';
          cfg.headshape = 'elekta/strio_jn.mat';
          ft_realtime_headlocalizer(cfg);
          @simonhomoelle can you have a look?
