          It was noticed by Stefan (CC) that sampleinfo is dropped in this case. This happens around line 410

          if avgovertime || ~isequal(cfg.latency, 'all')
            % these are invalid after averaging or making a latency selection
            keepfield = setdiff(keepfield, {'sampleinfo'});
          end

          It would be nice to update sampleinfo rather than to drop it.
