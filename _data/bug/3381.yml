        thetext: "We have migrated all website content from the wiki to another system (Jekyll), which now results in static files. That means that the complete site can be run on a simple server, as it is just a set of html and image files. \n\nPlease advice on which server these files can be placed and how to implement the automatic transfer whenever the site is updated."
