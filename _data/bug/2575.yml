        thetext: "I noticed that ft_chantype only works for 1020 EEG labels (not sure if it's always been the case, I don't think so because in SPM automatic channel type setting also worked for Biosemi). Looking around line 544 in ft_chantype I see that it checks 1020 labels 3 times which I think is redundant, it's enough to only compare with 1005. But instead I suggest to have:\n\ntype(match_str(label, ft_senslabel(ft_senstype(input)))) = {'eeg'};  \n\nThis will work for any EEG label set. I tried it and it seems to work well. Do you see any problems with it?\n\nVladimir"

        thetext: "I suspect that it works for Biosemi because of lines 86 and further:\n\nif isfield(input, 'chantype')\n  % start with the provided channel types\n  type = input.chantype(:);\nelse\n  % start with unknown type for all channels\n  type = repmat({'unknown'}, numchan, 1);\nend\n\nThis only has effect if the input is a header or grad structure, not if it only channel labels. \n\nThe 1005 system indeed includes all 1010 and 1020 labels, also the M, A and T channels, so the 3 calls could be changed by a single one.\n\nI am not sure whether your suggestion will always work. ft_senstype is not so robust, due to unusual combinations of channel labels, e.g. a mix of system specific labels (like EGI or Biosemi) with a subset of 1020 labels. \n\nHow about changing line 544 it into\n\nelseif ft_senstype(input, 'eeg') && islabel\n  % use an external helper function to define the list with EEG channel names\n  type(match_str(label, ft_senslabel('eeg1005'))) = {'eeg'};          % this includes all channels from the 1010 and 1020 arrangement\n  type(match_str(label, ft_senslabel(ft_senstype(input)))) = {'eeg'}; % this will work for biosemi, egi and other detected channel arrangements"

          I'm not sure it'll work so well because it'll detect any channel whose name matches one of the 1005 labels in any system. I suspect you can have names like C3 or P3 also in something which is not 1020. In most cases it'll be benign but who knows...

          Agreed. But it would only be for systems with ft_senstype=eeg, and for those I would assume that almost all channels have chantype=eeg anyway. Furthermore, this has been the behaviour for some time now and would not change. The only change is that non-1020 channels can also be marked as chantype=eeg.
