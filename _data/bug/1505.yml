Consequently the functions in the directory fieldtrip/multivariate (and all subdirectories) have moved to the directory fieldtrip/external/dmlt.\n\nIf you are using the multivariate analysis functions, e.g. though the cfg.method='crossvalidate' option in T_TIMELOCKSTATISTICS, T_FREQSTATISTICS or FT_SOURCESTATISTICS or the other methods explained on http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/multivariateanalysis, you should already have gotten used to addpath(genpath('fieldtrip/multivariate')). From now on you just have to update your path settings to point to external/dmlt instead of multivariate.\n\nIn the FieldTrip versions from this evening onward the code will not be present in the old location any more. \n\nbest regards,\nRobert"
