          localspheres plotted with ft_plot_vol

          At the moment ft_plot_vol plots all local-spheres when the input is a local-spheres head-model. We discussed this with Jan-Mathijs, and he told me to file this bug, because it would make more sense to plot a surface which consist of the points which are between a channel and the origin of its corresponding sphere in the distance of the sphere's radius. You can see in the attachment how the plotting looks right now.

          We used to have a better visualization of this in the past.

          Problematic is that the localspheres vol does (at this moment) not contain head surface points, and ft_plot_vol does not know about the grad structure to make the head surface points. The information now present inside ft_plot_vol therefore limits the plot to this. So to improve this, we have to add more information to that function or the vol structure.

        thetext: true. did not think of that. would it make sense to consider an orientation vector for each sphere, denoting the direction (from the corresponding origin) to the sensor?

          (In reply to comment #2)

          or just one surface point per sphere close to the sensor (which is almost the same)

          I created the above faq for people who want to plot a localspheres headmodel. Closing this bug for now.
