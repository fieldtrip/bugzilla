          The documentation of ft_databrowser mentions use of cfg.trl, only for use with trial-based data.  I'm entering trial-based timelock data (output of ft_timelockanalysis with keeptrials='yes') and yet it seems to ignore my use of cfg.trl but instead reverts to timelock.sampleinfo.

          I looked in the code of ft_databrowser and can't find any place where cfg.trl is used.  Nor is there a default set for it in the initial lines of 'set the defaults' (lines 156-182).   Is this cfg option obsolete (in which case, should be removed from documentation) or should it work?   Am I calling it wrongly?

          cfg=[];
          cfg.trl=timelock.sampleinfo(2:end,:);
          ft_databrowser(cfg,timelock)

          Thank you,
          Johanna

          I can confirm this.

          @Roemer: has this worked at some point?
          @Roemer: should it still work?

          If not, I suggest to remove it from the documentation altogether, because indeed cfg.trl does not seem to be interrogated (anymore) in the function

        thetext: I never used/worked on cfg.trl, so no idea. My guess would have been that it would be used if you only give the browser a cfg (since it's cfg.trl not cfg.trials), but a quick check told me it is ignored in that case as well. No idea why. Removal seems solid to me.
