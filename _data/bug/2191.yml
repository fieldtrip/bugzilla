        thetext: "There was a bug in the way that data.label was updated when cfg.avgoverchan='yes' for ft_selectdata_new.  The {} were missing, so that data.label was not a cell array.  I have fixed that (r8220).  It is correct in ft_selectdata_old.   \n\nBut in fixing it, I noticed the actual label is different between new and old.  \n\nFor example: (in new)\n\"chan001+chan002+chan003\"\n\nVersus (in old)\n\"mean(chan001, chan002, chan003)\"\n\nIsn't the old way correct, since it is actually a mean, not a sum, over channels? The old uses a utilities/private function 'avgoverlabel' to do this."
