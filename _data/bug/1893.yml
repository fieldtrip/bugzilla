          In this particular case I want to add an ID to the warning in ft_read_event.

          If ft_read_event does not recognize the format it will display the warning:

          otherwise
              warning('unsupported event format (%s)', eventformat);
              event = [];

          However when reading neurosim data and defining trials with ft_trialfun_general it will also call ft_read_event, and therefore always give me this warning.

          I want to control for this by using
          warning('off',ID)
          function_X
          warning('on',ID)

          To do this I propose changing ft_read_event to something like:

          otherwise
              warning('FT:no_event','unsupported event format (%s)', eventformat);
              event = [];

          TL;DR:
          Question: Is there a standard FieldTrip format for warning IDs?

        thetext: "the \"standard\" is that we don't do warning IDs, which is not ideal of course. \n\nIf we were to implement warning and error IDs, they would have to be unique throughout all code. The situation \"no_event\" might happen at multiple locations. I would also write out FT to FieldTrip.\n\nI suggest a scheme like\n  FieldTrip:filename:description\nwhich in this case would become\n  FieldTrip:ft_read_event:unsupported_event_format\n\nMy choice here would be _not_ to use the module/directory name, so no \n  FieldTrip:fileio:ft_read_event:unsupported_event_format\nbecause some functions reoccur at multiple locations and the directory organization might again change in the future."
