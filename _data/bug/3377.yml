          Currently, exercise 6 in the beamformer tutorial is didactically sub-optimal, because it asks for the exploration of different amounts of regularization, which don't seem to be making much of a difference. Every time when running this tutorial we have to apologetically say that based on the example regularization does not seem to be making much of a difference. I was just playing with some other data, and it seems that the value needs to be cranked up substantially, in order to appreciate the smoothing effect of this parameter. Thus, I suggest to use values such as '100%', or even '500%' to make the point.
