          as discussed in bug 2532, it is desireable to use ft_apply_montage more consistently with channel types and units. E.g. following megplanar, the type and units should be updated.

          Also conceivable is the following

          montage = [];
          montage.tra = 1e6;
          montage.labelold = {'Cz'};
          montage.labelnew = {'Cz'};
          montage.chanunitold = {'V'};
          montage.chanunitnew = {'uV'};

          Imagine applying this to data. Or imagine applying this to itself. If the input data has different but convertable units, the conversion could be done in ft_apply_montage.

          The following high-leve functions seem apply a montage to the data:

          mac011> grep -l ft_apply_montage *.m
          ft_preprocessing.m
          ft_prepare_layout.m
          ft_componentanalysis.m
          ft_rejectcomponent.m
          ft_denoise_pca.m
          ft_denoise_synthetic.m
          ft_megplanar.m
          ft_scalpcurrentdensity.m

          ft_preprocessing and ft_prepare_layout just use the montage from the cfg and do not make their own. Nothing needs to be done here.

          ft_componentanalysis and ft_rejectcomponent are specifically interesting, since they redistribute units between the time series and topographies. Hmm, this requires careful thought.

          I would expect ft_denoise_pca and ft_denoise_synthetic to keep the units the same. This should be easy to update.

          ft_scalpcurrentdensity and ft_megplanar really do something meaningful with the units in the time series. This requires a little bit more attention.

          there was a typo in the code that only became visible on another test script.

          Could you perhaps change the warnings in ft_apply_montage to disp? I don't think it's justified in these case to print our many scary red lines in the command window.
