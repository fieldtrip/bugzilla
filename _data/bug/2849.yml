          In volumethreshold.m

          %    m(cluster) = find(tmp==k, 1, 'last'); % determine the voxel count for each cluster
              m(k) = find(tmp==k, 1, 'last'); % determine the voxel count for each cluster

          The cluster is a large array, whereas m is only the size of the n clusters.  So the m(cluster) gives an error (only use int index... or something).  I replaced this with m(k), where k is the counter for the n clusters.  This gets the voxel count for the k cluster in the m(n-cluster) array.  This seems to work ok.  This error occurs on Windows and Linux.

          Also, in the same proc there is a print(....'\m').  This does not seem functional; and linux gives a warning that \m is not recognized.  I removed this and it worked fine.

          Hi John,

          I already fixed this recently, the present code does not use "find" any more. Please update to the latest FT version. See revision details below that pertain to the fix.

          best
          Robert

          bugfix - fixed regression error in volumethreshold, see bug 1954#c23. Also improved the segmentation in the test script, it was not good at the bottom of the head.

          bugfix - some small fixes and updates to the test script to get it to work. See http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=1954
