          Created attachment 346
          screen shot of test outcome history.

          Somehow, the test_tutorial_clusterpermutationfreq shows an alternating pattern of failing and passing. See also the attached screenshot. I find this very, very odd.

          Okay, I just confirmed this on my Windows computer. In revision 6709 this test passes, in revision 6710 it fails again. The only changes are unrelated (?) test scripts. According to the output of the script, the p-values are really different.

          I feel that the low probability of this pattern happening by chance warrants an upgrade of the severity of this bug.
