          Created attachment 268
          problematic file

          I got the attached file at the last SPM course. It doesn't convert properly with either 16bit or 32bit setting but it does convert OK in EEGLAB with 16bit setting.

          Hi Vladimir,
          What do you mean with improper converting? It loads the data in fine when I do ft_read_data(file), and the same for the header/events. Although it does look extremely noisy... is that what you are referring to?

          (CC: Robert, I assigned it to me in case it is related to my changes to loadcnt.m)

          Hi Roemer,

          I attached PDFs of what the data look like when converted in EEGLAB and in SPM. I hope you can appreciate the difference.

          Best,

        thetext: "Hi Vladimir,\n\nThanks for the attachments, it took me a while, but I found the source of the problem. \nTurns out we enforce a 'blockread' of 1 in the low-level read-function from EEGLAB. Normally this is automatically determined. \n\nI need a little bit of executive decision on this, as I don't fully oversee the purpose of enforcing the blockread to be 1. Robert, are you aware of this being necessary in some cases? Maybe it was necessary for the old version of loadcnt but no longer?\n\n\n\n***\nJust for documentation purpose, the following did not affect the issue:\n- enforcing a blockread of 1 in the header as well (now automatically determined)\n- enforcing 16bit/32bit/auto read of header and data\n- using the old version of loadcnt and:\n    * enforcing a blockread of 1 for header as well\n    * enforcing 16bit/32bit/auto read of header and data\nwhich of course all totally make sense not to affect the issue since it's the blockread"

          Hi,

          I tried to convert the same file and I get an error in SPM. Try:

          hdr = ft_read_header('cba1ff01.cnt');

          dat = ft_read_data('cba1ff01.cnt', 'header',  hdr, 'begsample',  105704, 'endsample', 206440,...
                      'chanindx', 1:hdr.nChans, 'checkboundary', 1);

          It should work as the samples are in bounds. I get:

          ??? Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch.

          Error in ==> loadcnt at 474
                  dat(:, counter*h.channeloffset+1:counter*h.channeloffset+h.channeloffset) = ...

          Error in ==> ft_read_data at 815
                tmp = loadcnt(filename, 'sample1', sample1, 'ldnsamples', ldnsamples);

          Nothing obvious I could figure out.

          not yet fixed, have to go now, but to summarize...

          the problem with 'cba1ff01.cnt' is in loadcnt and has to be solved there in consultation with Arno. In that solution (that has to be merged into eeglab), also FT bugfix #1412 needs to be incorporated.

          I have added some test cases to the script

          Hi Robert,

          I see this bug was left unfixed. I got a crash again this year with the line:

          dat = ft_read_data('family1.cnt', 'begsample', 156039, 'endsample',  215140);

          because the actual size of dat was different from the requested. I attach the file.

          There was also another strange cnt which looked a weird with some kind of pulse artefacts.The strange thing was that it looked the same no matter if converted wit 16 or 32 bit setting. I also have that if you want to look.

          Here is a correction of the copy-and-paste;

          there are two bugs related to neuroscan cnt, bug 1412 and bug 1490. My proposed
          solution (discussed with Vladimir over skype) is to move
          fieldtirp/fileio/private/loadcnt.m to fieldtrip/external/eeglan and merge it
          with the "official" eeglab version. That ensures that the flow of teh code and
          changes ot the code can be better tracked.
