          Chiran Doshi contacted me with the request to support the babySQUID MEG system. The file format is fif, so should be easy to work with.

          TODO:
          1) get some test datasets
          2) get some documentation on the geometry and triggering, preferably put it on http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/getting_started/babysquid
          3) write test script
          4) define new senstype (see fileio/ft_senstype.m)
          5) extend fileio/private/mne2grad.m

          Hi,
          I have sent a link to Robert with few fiff files and their corresponding *.eve files
          1) Only MEG with no triggers.
          2) Only MEG with triggers
          3) MEG and EEG peripheral
          4) MEG and EEG simultaneously

          In addition, I have sent BabySQUID.lout file containing coil geometries.
          Thanks,
          Chiran

          ...

          This is almost like the fieldtrip layout format (once introduced by Ole, who spent time in Helsinki, so might be affected by a neuromag file format). See http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/layout

          What is the significance of the first deviant line? If I remove it and rename it to *.lay, I get with the following code

          >> cfg = [];
          >> cfg.layout = 'BabySQUID.lay'
          >> ft_layoutplot(cfg)

          the attached figure. Not bad, but also not ideal.

          TODO => make good template layout for inclusion in fieldtrip

          Column three is is most cases always zero. (I believe it is useful when you need to mark a segment rather than a time point). Column four value is the event type you assign. For example 5 in the first line of the eve file is assigned as a Sync_pulse by us.

          ft_read_event function returns an event structure with the following fields
              event.type      = string
              event.sample    = expressed in samples, the first sample of a recording is 1
              event.value     = number or string
              event.offset    = expressed in samples
              event.duration  = expressed in samples

          Should the 3rd column then be mapped to event.duration? What is the unit of the duration?

          So I looked into the format of the eve file (MNE manual). It is supposed to be the value of the trigger channel at that sample. So keep it at 0. It has worked fine for both brainstorm and MNE so I do not expect any surprises.

          Hi Robert,
          I looked into the mne2grad function. Actually, I do not know exactly how will it translate to our coil type (axial gradiometer) since I have not done this before. I do have the coil dimensions with the integration points. If you can explain to me how to determine the coil positions for axial gradiometer, it would be perfect or I could provide you with the values. Either one works for me. I want to make sure we get this right.
          Let me know,

          Created attachment 414
          coil definitions used in mne

          Hi Robert,

          I have attached the mne2grad function and the coil_def.dat used in MNE. You will find the integration points and the geometry of the coils used by MNE and brainstorm in the coil_def.dat

             For the mne2grad function, I have assumed the bottom coil to be equivalent to magnetometer. For the top coil, I do not know how mne or brainstorm handles it. Does it calculate the location of the top coil on the fly using its geometry. Also I have made some changes to the code by adding nAxGrad at several places.

          Sorry could not be of much help with this. Let me know, how do you go about it.

          Please provide some information about the babysquid system. It can be as elaborate as you want, but I suggest to at least describe how triggers work, and how the coordinate system should be interpreted. Where is position [0 0 0] in relation to the baby and what are the x, y, and z-directions? When I looked at the 3D plot of the channel positions, I was not able to deduce how the head would have been. Have a look at the getting started for ctf, yokogawa, neuromag and bti to get some inspiration.

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #29)\nHi Robert,\nI have started to look into the FieldTrip toolbox and I noticed a few things that are causing potential issues with our system.\n\n1) I looked in the ft_filetype script and noticed that FieldTrip expects the fif and eve file to exist and should have the same name else it cannot determine eve file type and wrongly guesses babysquid fif file as neuromag_fif. This is a issue in case of spontaneous MEG recordings where there is no associated eve file. Is it possible to remove this dependency?\n\n2) I was trying to get ft_define_trial to work normally and it could not due to following reasons\n\na) By default ft_define_trial executes ft_trialfun_general for reading events and in the line where it calls ft_read_event, it expects that cfg.headerfile (my data file) contains the events. But it is not true in my case as I have a separate file. I looked into the documentation and it mentions that I can change the cfg.trialfun to execute ft_read_event instead of *_general but I could not figure out how to use it. Instead I added field cfg.readev (file name of my event file) and also created cfg.eventformat='babysquid_eve'. I edited a couple of lines in ft_trialfun_general to execute differently in case cfg.eventformat is babysquid_eve. \n\n\nHere are lines of code I edited and it fixed the issue\ntry\n      if strcmp(cfg.eventformat,'babysquid_eve') \n          event = ft_read_event(cfg.readev, 'eventformat',cfg.eventformat);\n      else\n        fprintf('reading the events from ''%s''\\n', cfg.headerfile);\n        event = ft_read_event(cfg.headerfile, 'headerformat', cfg.headerformat, 'eventformat', cfg.eventformat, 'dataformat', cfg.dataformat);\n      end\n\nb) For ft_define_trial to execute, it needs non-empty trl field. trl field in *_general depends on the event(i).value which is set to equal third column in read_babysquid_eve.m file. Generally that value is zero. Probably the concept of value in FieldTrip is different than the value in eve file. I changed line 43 : val3 = a(4,:)';\nand it works.\n\nI got the function ft_define_trial to work in the end but if you feel there is a better way to fix the issue, let me know. \n\nThanks,\nChiran"

        thetext: I received a fif dataset from Leipzig that included a fif and an eve file (see bug 2170 for some details). Using that dataset, I have been able to sofrt out how the columns in the eve file are actually to be interpreted (0-offset, not corrected for recording start, last column is event value rather than type). With this information I have updated the code to improve the general eve/fif handling. I have removed the specific babysquid_fif and babysquid_eve identifiers as fileformat, since it now works fine with the normal neuromag_mne (default).
