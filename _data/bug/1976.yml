          consider line 807 and 882 from ft_sourceanalysis:

          807: avg = reshape(avg, [1 Nchans Nsamples]);

          882: dip(i) = minimumnormestimate(grid, sens, vol, squeeze(avg(i,:,:)), optarg{:});

          and following MATLAB feature:

          >> Nchans = 21; Nsamples = 1; A = zeros(Nchans,Nsamples); A = reshape(A,[1 Nchans Nsamples]); size(squeeze(A(1,:,:)))

          ans =

               1    21

          >> Nchans = 21; Nsamples = 2; A = zeros(Nchans,Nsamples); A = reshape(A,[1 Nchans Nsamples]); size(squeeze(A(1,:,:)))

          ans =

              21     2

          it generated an error in line 211 of minimumnormestimate

          211: mom = w * dat;

          same occurs for another inverse solution methods

        thetext: "Hi Pawel,\n\nThanks for spotting this, and including the useful example test file.\nIt is a silly Matlab feature.  For now, I will make this patch in the MNE section of ft_sourceanalysis (as of SVN version 7450):\n\n      if size(avg,3)==1\n        squeeze_avg = avg(i,:)';\n      else\n        squeeze_avg = squeeze(avg(i,:,:));\n      end\n      if hascovariance \n        dip(i) = minimumnormestimate(grid, sens, vol, squeeze_avg, optarg{:}, 'noisecov', squeeze(Cy(i,:,:)));\n      else\n        dip(i) = minimumnormestimate(grid, sens, vol, squeeze_avg, optarg{:});\n      end\n\nThen your test script runs fine.\n\nHowever, I wonder which other methods within ft_sourceanalysis this may apply to.  Note, some methods won't like only 1 time point, but it's ok for MNE, so I don't think it's as simple as adding these lines for all methods.  I will add more later about that."

          I have updated it for all timelock methods.
          Svn commit 7520.

          test function added svn commit 7521, based on your bug example attached to this bug.  (this means a test of the code will run automatically if changes to ft_sourceanalysis are made in future)

          I consider this bug fixed, but please re-open if you are not satisfied.

          Johanna wrote "I consider this bug fixed, but please re-open if you are not satisfied." It seems to me that the bug has been resolved, but the present status is "REOPENED". I will close it once more as FIXED, if anyone objects please reopen and state why there is still a concern.
