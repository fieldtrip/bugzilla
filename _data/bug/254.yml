        thetext: At the moment, checkdata checks whether the input is freq, timelock or comp data (in the case of topoplotER/TFR). This should ideally work by only checking whether the absolutely necessary dimension is present in the data. For topoplotER/TFR this is the 'chan' dimension, which can be extracted from the dimord. For multiplotER this would be 'chan' as well and 'time'/'freq'/etc, andsoforth for the other functions. This will most likely require changes in ft_checkdata, but I do not have the oversight to know for sure (e.g. I don't think it accepts multiple dimords, dimords with wild-cards, etc).

        thetext: It is fixed, ft_datatype now properly checks for the necessary dimensions only (at least in the case of freq, where it failed in some cases).
