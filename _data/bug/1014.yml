          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

          question: what is to happen with

          a.time   = [1 2];
          a.label  = {'chan'};
          a.avg    = [1 1];
          a.dimord = 'chan_time';
          a.trial  = reshape([3 3; 0 0; 0 0], [3 1 2]);
          a.trialdimord = 'rpt_chan_time';

          aa = ft_appendtimelock([], a, a)
          here I would expect aa.trial to contain 2 trials (i.e. the two averages)

          or perhaps(?)

          aa.avg = 2x1x2
          aa.var = 2x1x2
          aa.dimord = 'rpt_chan_time'


          b.time   = [1 2];
          b.label  = {'chan'};
          b.avg    = [1 1];
          b.avgdimord = 'chan_time';
          b.trial  = reshape([3 3; 0 0; 0 0], [3 1 2]);
          b.dimord = 'rpt_chan_time';

          bb = ft_appendtimelock([], b, b)
          here I would expect bb to contain 2*3=6 trials

          (In reply to comment #7)
          Discussed at FT meeting today: why do we have .trial anyway? ft_freqanalysis with keeptrials='yes' just gives you an extra 'rpt' dimension in your powspctrm fields. By analogy, ft_timelockanalysis should give avg with a 'rpt' dimension; or better, rename avg to something like 'dat' or 'field'.

          To be discussed further, perhaps.

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #9)\n\nit is indeed inconsistent to call it avg (the operation applied to the data) versus trial (the observation of the data over multiple repetitions). But then, \"dat\" is too generic.\n\nconsistent with freq.powspctrm would be timelock.erp/erf, but that is confusing for the MEG/EEG folks, respectively. \n\nevent-related-signal is a representational name: timelock.ers? Just as bad as event-related-data (erd).\n\nevent-related-amplitude? \n\n\nBut does it actually matter? If I have \n\nftstructure.xxx\nwith either\nftstructure.xxxdimord\nor\nftstructure.dimord\nit should be fine, right?\n\nand \n\nftstructure.xxx\nftstructure.xxxdimord\nftstructure.yyy\nftstructure.yyydimord\n\nwould be fine.\n\nAlso \n\nftstructure.xxx\nftstructure.dimord  <- pertaining to the most important field\nftstructure.yyy\nftstructure.yyydimord\n\nshould be fine.\n\nI suggest that this one [[X see below X]] \nis considered valid:\n\ntimelock.avg\ntimelock.var\ntimelock.dimord = chan_time\ntimelock.cov\ntimelock.covdimord = chan_chan (usually)\ntimelock.trial\ntimelock.trialdimord = rpt_chan_time\n\n\nI leave it up to discussion as to whether cfg.keeptrials=yes should also output timelock.avg (which it does currently) or not (more consistent with other uses of keeptrials). E.g. consider\n\nif keeptrials=yes and covariance=yes then\n\ntimelock.trial\ntimelock.dimord = rpt_chan_time (the most important field)\ntimelock.cov\ntimelock.covdimord = rpt_chan_chan\n\nwhereas if keeptrials=no and covariance=yes then\n\ntimelock.avg\ntimelock.var\ntimelock.dimord = chan_time\ntimelock.cov\ntimelock.covdimord = chan_chan (in this case)\n\n\nPerhaps we should just discontinue to output both avg and trial, although according to the data definition [[X see above X]] it should be valid."

          the test script test_bug1014 is running though without errors. Furthermore, I have not noticed any unusual behaviour, hence I will mark this bug as resolved.

          Please reopen (and explain why) if you disagree.
