          This is the case when the input data has variable trial length.
          The cause can be tracked down to line 279 in getdimord, where the values in the variable datsiz are compared to [nrpt nchan ntime]. ntime is based on the number of elements in the data structure's first time-axis, whereas the third element of datsize seems to be based on the longest trial. This comparison fails, and hence the dimord is set to {unknnown}_unknown_unknown, which causes the datfield trial not to be rpt-selected in ft_selectdata.

          @ Nietzsche: this may have seerious consequences for the changes you made to mous_erf_pipeline, because the trial subselection you built in relied on ft_selectdata performing correctly (now all data fields (e.g. importantly the trialinfo field) are correctly selected, safe the trials). Currently it leads to a mismatch between actual trials and what we think they contain.

          It can be replicated by:

          data.trial={1 2 3 [4 5]};
          data.time={1 1 1 [1 2]};
          data.label={'chan01'};

          cfg.trials=[3 4];
          dataout=ft_selectdata(cfg,data);

          I changed line 57 in getdimord from

          ntime = length(data.time{1})

          into

          tmp   = getdimsiz(data, 'time');
          ntime = tmp(3); % raw data may contain variable length trials

          This seems to solve the issue.

          @Robert: agreed?

          @Nietzsche: let's recompute some stuff

          Dat moet ik eens bekijken op een regulier moment. Maar ik heb wel vertrouwen in je
          zaterdagavond-oordeel. Fijn weekend, Robert

          with the previous comment I meant that I don't have a suggestion. This 'closed fixed' bug specifically pertained to the selection of trials from a raw data structure, not to a selection of the subset of the time points in the trials of a data structure.

          I agree that the function's help suggests 'poststim' as an option, but rather than selectdata, I'd use ft_redefinetrial. Still, please feel free to suggest us with a fix for ft_selectdata to improve it's behavior.

        thetext: a contribution to improving ft_selectdata would (although it will be more work for you) be also much appreciated.
