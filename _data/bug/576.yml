          this appears to also hold for the raw data file.

          this is the fif-file now located in /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/original/meg/neuromag122

          (In reply to comment #7)

          I reran test_ft_preprocessing and test_ft_timelockanalysis on the affected input file. In the process, I encountered a bug in test_ft_timelockanalysis: the variable within the mat file had been renamed from data into timlock. I fixed it, the code is now more robust against this.

          mbp> svn commit
          Sending        test/test_ft_timelockanalysis.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 4810.
