          I just had a chat with Edward, and he mentioned that TG has done some tests, noticing that probably higher Matlab versions should work 'well' again.

          I quickly tried on matlab2016b, and that indeed looks much better.

          We googled some more about these opengl issues.

          According to this link:
          https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=154775

          ...also referring to this link:
          http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9959306/how-to-tell-mex-to-link-with-the-libstdc-so-6-in-usr-lib-instead-of-the-one-i

          ...people suggest to re-create a new symlink to the libstdc++ system library in stead of the matlab library.

          This is what I tried for matlab2012b (and only this version...)

          As root:
          # cd /opt/matlab/R2012b/sys/os/glnxa64
          # ls libstdc++.so.6
          libstdc++.so.6 -> libstdc++.so.6.0.13
          # mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.bak
          # ln -s /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6.0.19 libstdc++.so.6

          Now opengl functionality seems to be available again though as TG-member I am afraid to break other matlab functionalities.... That's why for now we only tested with matlabversion 2012b.

          Can anyone confirm opengl functionality and check if matlab2012b still runs as expected?

          Best,
          Ed.

          Using the test data as specified in my comment 2, the visualization works fine!

          I did not exhaustively test any other functionality, but basic arithmetic operations still work (I tried 1+1 on the command line, and got 2 as an answer :o) )

          There's not so much to be done about this.

          Recommendation:

          -run functionality that heavily relies on advanced openGL graphics stuff locally.
          -us a late version of matlab
