          Hi,

          unfortunately an external program (vgrid), which is only available for linux
          and mac os x, has to be used for the mesh creation so far. We are currently
          working on a matlab-implementation of the mesh generation to circumvent this
          problem. Hopefully, we will be able to provide a first version in a few weeks.

          Best, Johannes

          Ok. Thanks a lot for your reply. It will be really helpful for me to have the MATLAB code as currently I am stuck in this part. Kindly inform me on munsif.jatoi@gmail.com as soon as you develop the code.

          Kind Regards,
          Munsif.

        thetext: Since Lilla does not work on FieldTrip anymore, I don't think that it makes sense to keep this assigned to her. Also, assigning it back to the team won't speed up its resolution. Since the bug has 'simbio' in its title I suggest to assign it to Simon, who may be the best one to review it, and either follow up on it, or close it.

        thetext: On the skype meeting today Johannes told that all the whole simbio pipeline is coded in matlab. The only exception is the part where the stiffness matrix is computed. This is done through a MEX-file. I check if they are working on different OS.

          By checking out external/simbio I realised that also write/read_vista_mesh is a MEX-file

          Yes, that's true I forgot about that. Since it's a routine only for reading vista-meshes to matlab I would assume that it only seldomly needed. To enable previous SimBio-users to switch to FieldTrip-SimBio we should nevertheless try to keep it.
