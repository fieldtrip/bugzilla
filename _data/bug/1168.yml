          Can anyone clarify, or find someone to assign this issue to? I can't understand the issue based on Linsey's description and Roberts script.

          why not use ft_multiplotER?

          is the eventual problem the fact that singleton dimensions cannot be dealt with?

          (In reply to comment #2)

          The problem is that the dimensions in the .dimord are not taken into account. The functions seems to assume that the second dimension is time and the third frequency (and you cannot plot it the other way around).

          (In reply to comment #3)

          It is indeed possible to use a multiplotER, but by eye it is much easier to interpret the results when it is plotted as an image.

        thetext: "1) It would be possible to make the function more generic by allowing cfg.yparam, cfg.xparam and cfg.paramenter to be set manually in the cfg. Right now, defaults are:\n\nif ~any(ismember(dimtok, 'time'))\n  error('input data needs a time dimension');\nelse\n  xparam = 'time';\n  yparam = 'freq';\n  cfg.parameter = ft_getopt(cfg, 'parameter', 'powspctrm');  \nend\n\n\nEverything else in the code already adheres to a generic programming style (e.g. data.(xparam) is accessed rather than data.time)\n\n2) MATLAB cannot deal probably with a singleton dimension which is 'somewhere' in a matrix. Most operations on a Nx1xM matrix will squeeze the matrix to NxM. A workaround/hack is to just double the singleton dimension to Nx2xM (this is what I would do if I were you, Linsey). \nIn theory, this could also be done by default in ft_multiplotTFR. The user would not notice that this is being done internally and yet give the desired result.\n\n3) ft_multiplotTFR can now deal with dimords of any order (if there is no singleton dimension):\n\n% get dimord dimensions\ndims = textscan(data.dimord,'%s', 'Delimiter', '_');\ndims = dims{1};\nydim = find(strcmp(yparam, dims));\nxdim = find(strcmp(xparam, dims));\nzdim = setdiff(1:ndims(dat), [ydim xdim]);\n% and permute\ndat = permute(dat, [zdim(:)' ydim xdim]);\n\nSending        ft_multiplotTFR.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 5302.\n\n\n\nI need input on 1) and 2)"

          @1: ok, I can live with this (less work for me, hooray)

          @2:
          there was a bug in the testscript... so forget the singleton/squeeze stuff (this was caused by the wrong testscript)

          anyway, the problem still remains that if, e.g., the time-axis consists of a single sample, then ft_multiplotTFR does not plot anything. As a workaround/hack, I suggested to make it artificially two samples long, so that a colored stripe can be plotted.

          Hey Linsey,

          we just discussed this in the FT meeting. So, we won't change the function. However, for you to make it work, you can just repmat the time-dimension, so that a box can be drawn from min to max which has a finite dimension.

          Otherwise, you could still use ft_topoplotTFR and play around with interpolation, e.g. with cfg.interpolation set to 'nearest' and cfg.style set to 'straight' or so

          I don't think we should add xUnit to fieldtrip/external; we don't want 20 people downloading it every day in the zip file.

          But we can add it to ft_hastoolbox, and then put it on home/common. Around line 356 in that function it checks whether the particular toolbox can be found on home/common, so thereby it could be auto-added.
