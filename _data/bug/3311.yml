          In commit aa3e7f2 the line 62 in file ft_preproc_polyremoval.m was deleted:
          typ = class(dat);

          It seems like now the function cannot be executed because nothing can be returned on the line 93:
          dat = cast(dat, typ);

          As far as I can see, this has now been fixed with commit 04629a5.

          Sorry for the inconvenience.
