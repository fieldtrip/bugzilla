          confirmed.

          I can solve the second problem (with the nans), but I am not sure how to address the missing output argument.

          In the absence of coils being drawn, hs reflects a (single) handle to the set of points (as obtained by a call to plot3).

          When the coils are drawn, the subfuncion plotcoil is used, which creates a patch-object for each of the coils, hence an array of handles.

          How does SPM rely on the output argument of this function? can it handle an array of handles, or does it require a single handle?

          We change the colour. Yes return an array and I'll make sure we can do something with it.

          OK, implemented with pull request 203.

          Note that when plotting the sensors as points hs is a handle to a lineseries object, and when the sensors are plotted as coils hs is an array of axis handles

          Oh, and isn't there an option in ft_plot_sens to change the color?
          Should we look into this?

          I think the option 'edgecolor' is intended to determine the color.

          Hi Jan Mathijs,

          I looked at the current code and I see that although it makes quite nice plots for Neuromag and CTF, for EEG and just magnetometers the only thing you can get is a small black dot and that looks quite ugly. Isn't there a way to at least have something like a sphere as with the previous code?

          Vladimir
