        thetext: How about making cfg.trialdef.eventtype = '?' the default, e.g. when someone who has not been using FT in a while forgets to set cfg.trialdef at all? would have been handy and saved me a few seconds of my time ;)

        thetext: "eventtype=? only applies to ft_trialfun_general (which is also the default). So this would not apply if someone specifies an explicit trialfun.\n\nThe idea might be that if trialfun and trialdef are both empty, that it would print a report. Should we consider moving this from ft_trialfun_general to ft_trialfun_report?\n\nDoes this not interfere with making a single long (continuous) data segment?\n\nI know that if I now do \ncfg = [];\ncfg.dataset = something continuous\nft_preprocessing(cfg)\nI get a single continuous segment (and no errors or warnings).\n\nWhat would happen now if I do this\ncfg = [];\ncfg.dataset = something continuous\ncfg = ft_definetrial(cfg)\ndata = ft_preprocessing(cfg)\nand what would we want to happen?"

          (In reply to Jörn M. Horschig from comment #1)

          Since Jörn won't be offended, I suggest not to do this, also based om Robert's comment #2. Let's close.
