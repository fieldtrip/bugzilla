          a question to be looked into: is there any reason not to use the standard 1020 layout?

          Please look at the EEG1020, EEG1010 and EEG1005 and the elec1020, 1010 and 1005. I don't know why they seem to be present twice...

          Hi, This was not on behalf of Madelon.  She is happy with the 1020 (1010
          extended) layout 2D file for topoplotting.   I filed this in response to a
          request at the toolkit from someone with EEG data wanting to do source
          localization, hence needed the 3D standard positions (although I recommended
          using Polhemus to get the actual positions per subject).  The acticap does not
          follow the 1020 positions (I attach the Acticap layout and a second plot of the
          positions relative to 1020).

          the layout from the example script - is for the ActiCap that is used in the EEG lab in the MPI (here in Nijmegen).

          It is the EasyCap 64-channel system. It is exactly the same system as we use in the Donders, but the arrangement of channels is not the same (!).
          I am not sure if we want to put it into the Template folder. I am afraid people who record their data in Donders will be confused))
          By the way, I have the layout file for the Donders 64-channel cap as well. That one I can share.

          screenshot of dccn and mpi version

          I have attached a screenshot, with in the left column the dccn_customized_acticap64 and in the right column the mpi_customized_acticap64 layout (both in MATLAB figure and in the original bitmap).

          From the figure it now becomes clear that the MPI version still needs some editing. The outermost channels (e.g. 26 = Oz) don't lie on the rim in MATLAB, whereas they do in the bitmap.

          Also REF (left mastoid) is missing, as is GND.

          For RM (right mastiod, for which the correct name according to the 10-20 standard from Jasper 1958 would have been M2) it would be good to include it twice, once with the label "RM" and once with the label "32".

          The positions are not different in the two versions (and is also the same as the M10 positions), it is just the labeling. So I'll take the dccn_customized_acticap64.mat file, copy it to mpi_customized_acticap64.mat and change the labels.
