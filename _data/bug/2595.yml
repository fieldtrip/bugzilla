        thetext: Arno reported some issues that had to do with data bookkeeping in FT. This should not break eeglab/dipfit. Hence we should make a small test script for a regression test.

          I did it similar to the test_SPM_ft_integration script. The test is not very strict, only that it runs through. Perhaps we want to extend the test and check the output numbers as well.
