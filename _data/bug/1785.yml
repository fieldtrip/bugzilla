        thetext: The file format for the waveguard cap used in the HCP is slightly different from previous ANT *.elc file formats, hence the reading functinos have to be updated.

          @Abbas, can you please confirm that this file was written with software from ANT? It looks so, but is quite different from previous versions of the *.elc file format.

As you know, the *.elc format does not contain any additional comments, for example specifying the Reference channel, thus, I did not use this format. The EEG config file is based on *.vhdr format of BrainVision but I did not use exactly same format. \n\nBest,\nAbbas"
