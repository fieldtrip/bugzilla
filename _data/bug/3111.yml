          agreed, I think that this is not needed (any more).

          Can you fork it and make a pull request on github?

          I would recommend to not remove that error or at least I would give a clear warning. Applying the Hilbert transform on broad band data is almost always a terrible idea, even in the case when the data is noise free (as far as it is non-harmonic).

          If you want an example try to perform the Hilbert transform on a sawtooth or a square wave signal and check whether the extracted envelope and frequency makes sense at all.

          The only class of signals for which you can directly apply the Hilbert are those one that are already narrow band.

        thetext: good point. Then I propose to change the error in a warning.

        thetext: I will take this one. I came across this recently in my own work. Pity that it hasn't been resolved yet.
