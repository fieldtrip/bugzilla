          Although the options exist to give cfg.timwin, this does not solve the problem of not having time as inputargument as seen in error

          ??? Input argument "time" is undefined.

                 Error in ==> specest_nanfft at 58
                 fsample = 1/(time(2)-time(1));

                 Error in ==> ft_spiketriggeredspectrum at 122
                 spike_fft = my_fft(spike);

          This may be my own error in cfgs in preprocessing the raw data, but I do not know.

        thetext: spiketriggeredspectrum computes an fft for a timwin around the spike. The output should not contain a time.

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
