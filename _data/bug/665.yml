          Trying to read in our own data (275 channel CTF MEG system) or even the tutorial data the function ft_definetrial fails.

          After checking several versions of fieldtrip I realized that in version fieldtrip-20110510 the bug does not exist. For all later versions (20110511 / 20110512) the functions fails using the following code (taken fromm the tutorial):

          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
          cfg                         = [];
          cfg.dataset                 = 'Subject01.ds';
          cfg.trialdef.eventtype      = 'backpanel trigger';
          cfg.trialdef.eventvalue     = 3; % the value of the stimulus trigger for fully incongruent (FIC).
          cfg.trialdef.prestim        = 1; % in seconds
          cfg.trialdef.poststim       = 2; % in seconds

          cfg = ft_definetrial(cfg);
          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



          The error message is the following:

          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
          ??? Error using ==> and
          Inputs must have the same size.

          Error in ==> trialfun_general at 121
            sel = sel & ismember({event.type}, cfg.trialdef.eventtype);

          Error in ==> ft_definetrial at 140
              [trl, event] = feval(cfg.trialfun, cfg);
          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
