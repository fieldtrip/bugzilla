          E.g., after ft_definetrial the next logical step is often ft_preprocessing.

          As discussed with Robert and Lilla, I will do the following:

          - Make a standard syntax that can be added in comments in the matlab source code, after help. Something like the following for ft_preprocessing:

          % PIPELINE
          % PREV: ft_definetrial, ft_preprocessing
          % NEXT: ft_timelockanalysis, ft_freqanalysis, ft_componentanalysis

          - Update ft_documentationreference such that it extracts these codes and puts them in an appropriate format on the wiki reference page.

          - Change dokuwiki (e.g. through a custom plugin) such that it knows how to display this information on the reference pages. Preferably through some awesome flowchart or something.

        thetext: "if I remember well, the idea for the update of the reference documentation was the following:\n\nuse of each function should be described with consistent naming of the input and output data-types:\n\ne.g.\n\ntimelock = ft_timelockanalysis(cfg,preproc)\n\n(instead of data=ft_function(cfg,data))\n\nBut I think the naming of the data types should be discussed further. \n\nLilla"
