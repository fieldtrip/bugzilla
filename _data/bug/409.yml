          Hi Vladimir

          ft_compute_leadfield does not use it, but ft_prepare_vol_sens does.

          why is this part (line 73) not executed properly?

          % determine the skin compartment
          if ~isfield(vol, 'skin_surface')
            if isfield(vol, 'bnd')
              vol.skin_surface   = find_outermost_boundary(vol.bnd);
            elseif isfield(vol, 'r') && length(vol.r)<=4
              [dum, vol.skin_surface] = max(vol.r);
            end
          end

          and then in line 345  it once more does

                  if ~isfield(vol, 'skin_surface')
                    vol.skin_surface = find_outermost_boundary(vol.bnd);
                    fprintf('determining skin compartment (%d)\n', vol.skin_surface);
                  end

          if it cannot be reproduced, then lets close it.

          best,

          <<once more, I forgot to actually change the status to CLOSED>>

          I closed all the bugs that I resolved earlier today. These have been discussed
          at the Fieldtrip meeting and should not show up any more at the next meeting.
          If you feel that one of these bugs should not have been closed, you have to
          reopen it.
