        thetext: "Hi,\n\nMy name is Marco Curado and I just started using Fieldtrip, aiming at source reconstruction of MEG event-related fields data using MNE. I tried using the fieldtrip tutorial available at the link:\n\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/minimumnormestimate\n\nSpecifically the part:\n---\nload mri_tal;\nload seg;\n\n% ensure that the skull-stripped anatomy is expressed in the same coordinate system as the anatomy\nseg.transform = mri_tal.transform;\n\n% save both the original anatomy, and the masked anatomy in a freesurfer compatible format\ncfg             = [];\ncfg.filename    = 'Subject01';\ncfg.filetype = 'mgz';\ncfg.parameter   = 'anatomy';\nft_volumewrite(cfg, mri_tal);\n\ncfg.filename    = 'Subject01masked';\nft_volumewrite(cfg, seg);\n---\n\nbut unfortunately using Subject01 data and the pieces of code provided by the tutorial this step 6 - \"save to disk\" - was impossible to complete because the following message appears:\n\n\"Index exceeds matrix dimensions.\n\nError in ft_volumewrite (line 124)\n  cfg.parameter = cfg.parameter{1};\"\n\nIndeed, cfg.parameter is \"anatomy\" in the first loop at the volumewrite function, but at the second it becomes an empty cell. So, impossible to identify what is cfg.parameter{1}.\n\nCan anyone help me with that? I would like first to try this tutorial with fieldtrip data and then use my own. \n\n\nMany many greetings and thanks in advance,\nMarco Curado\n\nPS: attached, the seg.mat and mri_tal.mat used from Subject01."

          Hi Marco,

          Thanks a lot for your email. You get an errror message at ft_volumewrite because it doesn't find the 'anatomy' field in the input (i.e. seg). It is because there is no anatomy field in the seg that you have sent me.

          In an earlier version of fieldtrip, there was a bug in ft_volumesegment. When {'skullstrip' 'brain'} was requested as output fields from ft_volumesegment the output (seg) structure did not contain the anatomy field anymore. This bug was fixed since then, and I suspect that your seg structure is missing the anatomy field because you are using an earlier version of fieldtrip which contained this bug.

          I think if you download the latest fieldtrip version, and do the analysis again from creating the seg structure with ft_volumesegment, it will probably work out.
          Please, let me know if you experience further problems.

          Best,
          Lilla
