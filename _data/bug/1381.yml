          Hi Yoni,

          Thanks for your report. Other people have reported the same issue as you, therefore I am marking this bug as a duplicate of bug 1258. A few workarounds are suggested in that bug, perhaps one of them could help you as well.

          In general, we are working on streamlining the compilation of MEX-files on our end, and hopefully these issues will not occur anymore in the near future.

          Best,
          Eelke
