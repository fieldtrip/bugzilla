        thetext: "Dear Fieldtrip developers,\n\nToday I noticed that Ft_definetrial gave an error (line 179) when I tried to read biosemi_bdf EEG data using the Donders' Torque Fieldtrip. Last week the exact same cfg worked on the same data. \n\nI think it has to do with a revision of ft_read_event. When I use eventtype = '?' no error appears; however, it finds 0 events and creates 0 trials.\n\nHope you can fix this! Thanks already!\nDavid Meijer"

        thetext: "Hi David,\n\nthanks for notifying. I made a change there yesterday, see bug 2409. \n\nI tested it with all files that I had at hand, but apparently not all possible cases were covered. Could you send me a (possibly small) file with which you have the problem? Then I can try to understand what the code is doing in your case. \n\nIn the mean time, I will revert the code back to the pre-yesterday version.\n\nRobert"
