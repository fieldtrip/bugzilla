        thetext: At the moment, clusterplot can only plot TFR clusters if there is no longer a frequency dimension in the data, as it only knows how to plot over different timepoints. It does so by subplotting each timepoint in one window, until 15 plots are made, which is when it switches to a new figure window. Ideally, subplots should only be used for e.g. timepoints, and figure windows for different frequencies.

        thetext: "Apart from not being able to plot over frequencies, the use of cfg.xlim is not allowed. So, plotting output from timelock_statistics, which usually has many time-points, will cause an explosion of (sub)figures to be plotted (see somewhat related bug 1472). \n\nIdeally one should be able to specify a cfg.xlim and cfg.ylim to specify freqs and time-points to be plotted (e.g. time-points as subplots, freqs as figure windows). The easiest would be to give it clusterplot an overhaul and start roughly from scratch. I wonder though, whether it is worthwhile to invest in this. I haven't heard from many folks around me that they use ft_clusterplot, let's discuss at the ft-meeting."
