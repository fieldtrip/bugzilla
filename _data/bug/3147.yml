        thetext: "Due to a commit dating back to December 2014 (!), interp_gridded is broken. There's a mix up between a variable which I think was originally called 'pnt', and was changed into 'pos' by our always zealous general. This causes a clash with the also (already prior to the change) defined 'pos'. \nI have already started a separate branch and fixed the code (using pos_to and pos_from consistently). While I am at it, I suggest to also use this naming convention in interp_ungridded (which uses pntin and pntout)."
