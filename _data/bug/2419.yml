          I am able to run everything up to the MNE with no problem, and it seems like the MNE portion works.  But when I run the command bnd = ft_read_headshape('Subject01-oct-6-src.fif', 'format', 'mne_source');
          and then plot it to visualize the source space.  I get the error Reference to non-existent field 'use_tri_area'. Error in ft_read_headshape (line 421) shape.area = [src(1).use_tri_area(:); src(2).use_tri_area(:)];
           I have looked on this site and online and can't find an explanation of what is wrong or how to fix the problem.  Any help would be appreciated.  I am using an Anatomical MRI scan for the head model analysis, the skull is present and I manually am Identifying the fiducials.    Also, a few steps earlier it had me check the white matter segmentation done by Freesurfer and that worked fine and what I get closely resembles the tutorial.  So I think the problem is somewhere in the MNE I am just not sure where.  Any help would be appreciated.

          Hi Robert,
          I indeed suggested to Nicholas to also upload a faulty fif-file. Mine just work. Feel free to assign the bug to me. I added the areas to begin with.

          Hi Nicholas,
          Could you upload one of the fif-files causing a crash?

          that is the link to the file causing the crash.

        thetext: 'I think it has to do with how you specify the call to mne_create_source_space (I don''t recall from the top of my head how this function is called). If I remember well, you can either specify it to create the mesh with or without a triangulation attached (I think with --ico as an option: see http://martinos.org/mne/stable/manual/cookbook.html "setting up the source space"-section).'
