        thetext: "Hejsan,\n\nIt seems that when I record only a couple of channels (no MEG channels and two bipolar), chantypes are not found ('unknown'). This then results in ft_read_event not finding 'binaryindx' or 'analogindx' (ft_read_event, line 1214:). \n\nI would be happy to fix it, if anyone can give me a clue how to. Otherwise, it is at the moment not possible to specify chanindx when calling ft_read_event another way which would be a workaround. That option is only supported for Yokogama systems.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nBest,\nStephen"

        thetext: by the way, the default chanindx for events should be the channel called 'STI101' (which is correct in .label).

          Hi,

          I just changed my email notifications so I'll actually get updated when I'm assigned or CC'd :-)

          To return to the issue: is the team ok with adding chanindx as a option for neuromag_fif filetypes in ft_read_event? Or would it be better to try to improve chantype identification?

          For several reasons I prefer the first option, the main one being that it allows one to choose between the digital and analogue trigger channels.

          Best,
          Stephen
