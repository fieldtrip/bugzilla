          It is now in fieldtrip/external/spm8

          - the fact that SPM8 has to be included to compute cluster correction for multiple comparisons is strange, especially because it seems that you wrote the functions (spm_bwlabeln)! This is the only function needed. This function should be in a more common Fieldtrip folder (and you can duplicate it in SPM8 if you want to). I have also had to add the "spm.m" and "Contents.m" function of SPM so that Fieldtrip does not return an error (when SPM is absent).

          Robert adds: please note that I did not write the spm_bwlabel function, I just borrowed it from spm. When adding external/spm8 I forgot to disable the SVN $Id$ expansion, so now the log messages are not in line with the original SPM versions any more.

          I think that this is a reasonable request. It would just involve setting autosync=true, svn copy of the mex files, and checking whether the clustering code contains ft_hastoolbox (if so, it should be removed).
