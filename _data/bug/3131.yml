          "The specified procedure could not be found" suggests that a shared library (*.dll) cannot be found.

          Please download the free http://www.dependencywalker.com and open ft_getopt.mexw64 in that small utility. It will show which dependencies it has and which ones are missing. It is normal that the MATLAB ones are missing (as those are provided at the moment that matlab is running).

          Indeed, dependencycrawler finds many issues, mostly missing Windows libraries though. See attachment (there are more than fit the screen)

          I will try to compile (need to install win64 compiler first).

          Thanks,
          Stephen

The KERNEL32 depends on KERNELBASE, which depends other files that cannot be found. That (to me) suggests more a problem with your overall installation than a specific matlab/mexfile problem. I suspect that the EXT-MS-WIN-whatever dlls are not missing on disk, but that the path is not set correctly to allow them to be found. But it might also be that those dlls will be automatically added at execution time. \n\nIs there anything directly underneath FT_GETOPT (besides LIBMX and LIBMEX) that is missing?

          Forcing recompiling of mex files did again break at ft_getopt. See below. I also attached two more screenshots of the lower part of the output of the dependencycrawler.

          (In reply to Stephen Whitmarsh from comment #8)

          > undefined reference to `mxErrMsgTxt'

          this suggests that you are using an old fieldtrip copy. It should be mexErrMsgTxt (as of a certain matlab version) and that has been changed in the code quite some time ago.

          Can you check the ft_getopt.c file to see whether it is mxErrMsgTxt or mexErrMsgTxt?

          On which matlab version are you now trying to compile? Is that specific version compatible with MinGW64?
