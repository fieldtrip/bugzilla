      thetext: "Hi,\n\nit would be nice to do group-statistics on the MNE source reconstructions. \n\nWe have been discussing about this already, and as far as I understood one of the problems was how to compute the orientation of the 3D dipole moments. \nThere has been also some plans discussed to do a test related to this issue on a simulated data if it is necessary. We also could compare it to the MNE Suite solutions.\n\nOther issue is that at the moment we did group average where the time-axis has been removed (we averaged across time).\n\nAnd the third issue was that so far we interpolated the individual sheet onto a common MNI volume. But we also could do the group analysis on a common MNI sheet.\n\nI am looking forward for feedback on this issue and on how I could help in proceeding in it further.\n\nLilla"
