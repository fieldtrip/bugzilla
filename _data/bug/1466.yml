          Add more to this section, including what may be similar or different between FT and BrainVision Analyzer, what preprocessing steps of Analyzer software can be (or not) imported to FT.

          Also, (separate bug?) are there any preprocessing steps done in Analyzer that FT may want to include?  One suggestion from a toolkit participant was the eye-blink removal done in a manner akin to average artifact subtraction.  I don't know the details of how this is done in Analyzer.

Preferably people that received help from me before (in the line of 'Hello Mr. X, I helped you a while ago, now I need your help - can you do my homework for me?')"
