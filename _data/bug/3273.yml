        thetext: "The gNEEDaccess is a server/daemon that runs on a windows PC. You can connect to it over the network and control and view the EEG recordings of the amplifiers attached to that computer. \n\nMy plan is to implement a gtec2ft.exe application that copies the data from the gNEEDaccess interface to the FT buffer."

        thetext: "code has been written (on basis of gets linux example) and added to fieldtrip/realtime/src/acquisition/gtec. \n\nRight now it requires the user to type various things upon startup. I would prefer it to use an ini file for all settings, as we do elsewhere. This allows for unattended startup.\n\nDocumentation should be added to http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/realtime/implementation and http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/realtime/gtec"

        thetext: the current implementation has been tested and used a few times, so no urgent need to make further changes.
