          In today ft meeting we decided to work on the following todo list before lunching the ecog_tutorial online:


          ** remove the raw data from the ftp. Instead explain how the data is organized and how it relates to data of type raw and the FieldTrip logic. This should be a paragraph in the *preprocessing section*. Make a reference to the continuous tutorial.

          ** leave the lay.mat file on the ftp

          ** make some diagnostics on whether the data is common reference.

          ** contact Yuka- she might set up a link with the lab where the data is from.

          **

          Hi Tzvetan,

          Is there still progress to be expected on this tutorial, or should we declare it finished and make it visible? We are now writing related documentation and it would be good to be able to link the various intracranial documentation to each other.

          Robert

          To push this forward: I have made the tutorial visible, removed the warning and I have renamed the spike section in http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial into
          "Analysis of ECoG, iEEG, LFP and spike data" and listed it there.

          Ok, this means in terms of documentation what remains is the "summary and conclusion" part. I can do this tonight.

          Technically speaking, iEEG encompasses ecog and sEEG (stereotactic eeg) since theyre both intracranial.

          Alrighty, I just added this:
          http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/ecog?&#summary_and_conclusion
          and this:
          http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/ecog?&#suggested_further_reading

          Could you please have a quick look. Might be wordy at times ...

          I added some whitespace to break it up. For now it is perfect, in the future we can always revise and shorten.

          thanks!
