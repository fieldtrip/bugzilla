          The spike toolbox contains a test script called test_ft_spike_phaselockstat.
          The function that is referred to does not exist (ft_spike_phaselockstat).

          This function can still be found on the google repository:
          http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/browse/trunk/ft_spike_phaselockstat.m?spec=svn5003&r=5003

          It seems like it was removed because it was superseded by ft_spiketriggeredspectrum_stat. Can someone confirm this?

          In that case, the test function should be removed, such that it won't show up on the dashboard.
