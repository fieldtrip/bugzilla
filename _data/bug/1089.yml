          I noticed the following in topoplotER

          % The layout defines how the channels are arranged. You can specify the
          % layout in a variety of ways:
          %  - you can provide a pre-computed layout structure, see FT_PREPARE_LAYOUT
          %  - you can give the name of an ascii layout file with extension *.lay
          %  - you can give the name of an electrode file
          %  - you can give an electrode definition, i.e. "elec" structure
          %  - you can give a gradiometer definition, i.e. "grad" structure
          % If you do not specify any of these and the data structure contains an
          % electrode or gradiometer structure, that will be used for creating a
          % layout. If you want to have more fine-grained control over the layout
          % of the subplots, you should create your own layout file.

          I suggest to make a shorter description in the p[lotting functions and have the user refer to ft_prepare_layout for full details. Consequently, all of this info has to be merged with the help of ft_prepare_layout

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.
