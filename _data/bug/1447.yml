Try out the test script to see the differences. Note that \nset(gcf, 'color', [1 1 1])\nmakes the background white, which actually looks better on screen for some of them.\n\nmanzana> svn commit ft_multiplotER.m      \nSending        ft_multiplotER.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 5712.\n\nthe two previous commit contain the changes in the low-level plotting functions and a test script+data."
