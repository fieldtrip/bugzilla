        TO DISCUSS IN THE FIELDTRIP MEETING

        At the moment ft_datatype help contains a description of the function and "see also" to the other functions. The ft_datatype_xxx functions don't explain the function  behaviour, but only document the representation.

        Would it not make more sense to change ft_datatype help also into only a descriptive section about the representations and delete this section.

        % Use as
        %   [type, dimord] = ft_datatype(data)
        %   [status]       = ft_datatype(data, desired)

        Rather something like

        ----
        FieldTrip uses a number of standardized representations of the data as a MATLAB structure. A common feature is that the data structures are as small as possible, but still full self-explanatory. The following is a list of the most important datatypes. Each of these is explained in detail in the corresponding FT_DATATYPE_xxx function.

        then comes the list

        then comes the see also
        ----

        Then we can prevent the (difficult to maintain) cross-linking between all ft_datatype_xxx functions. They would just link back (with see also) to ft_datatype, which is the central hub in the explanation.
