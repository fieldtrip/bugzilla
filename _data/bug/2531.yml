          surfaceplot with cfg.funparameter avg.pow and maskparameter anatomy

          Hello,

           The plot I generated by ft_sourceplot using cfg.method  = 'surface' with
           either projectionemthod 'nearest' or 'project' looks funny. The frontal
           lobes don't show any activation, they are just left grey. And also specific
           activations on the cortex are shifted towards the back (y-axis). I compared
           the same 3-D- sourceactivation data (interpolated on the standard T1 output
           of ft_interpolate with ft_interpolate) in an orthoplot and there the
           sourceactivation is neatly arranged in the whole brain volume, including
           the frontal lobes. So that the mistake must origin in the ft_sourceplot
           function.
           I use the version of the 18th of December 2013. Also the latest version of yesterday is still having this problem. A version I used from first of january 2013 was not showing this problem, but I need  other functionalities of the later versions...

           Do you know this problem and can help me with it?
           If not, do you have an idea to solve it or cirumvent it?

           Thanks in advance,
           Marlene

I think the first thing you should check is whether the mesh in cfg.surffile is in register with the anatomical 3D image. \n\nft_plot_montage supports the option of plotting a mesh along with an anatomical image, to be used as:\n\noptions = {'transform', mri.transform,'nslice',16,'intersectmesh',{surfacemesh},...\n           'intersectlinewidth',1,'slicesize',[300 300]};\n\n        figure;\n        ft_plot_montage(mri.anatomy, 'location', [0 0 0], 'orientation', [0 0 1], 'slicerange', [-20 120], options{:});\n        \n\nmri is the anatomical volume, surfacemesh is the mesh loaded from the surffile.\n\nExtra note to Arjen: irrespective of the thing being an interpolation issue or not, this is a good example of why certain functionality should be represented at a single location, i.e. ft_sourceinterpolate. It keeps the code easier to manage.\n\nIf it's a registration issue, we should ensure that the anatomical template that can be used for source-interpolation (defined in standard space) is the one from which the template meshes have been derived (ensuring at least that these are defined in the same standard space)."

IN the ortho plot of both versions the blop also appears rather more frontal, corresponding to the location of the plot of the version of the 01.01.2013. So I  am pretty sure, that the activity is not correctly illustrated. \n\nThanks to both of you for taking care of that issue. \n\nAs a workaround I could do the plotting with the earlier version and the rest with the later version, but it makes everything a bit messy. \n\nBest, Marlene"

          OK guys, the problem was that the freesurfer surfaces are expressed in another coordinate system, which was not taken into account when I uploaded the template surfaces. I applied the transformation matrix from the surfrend toolbox to the surfaces and the result seems to make sense.

          The shitty thing is that the mis-registered surfaces have been introduced in the version of 13/12/2013, i.e. 5 days before the version that Marlene used, so it has been in FT for a while. Funny that nobody had noticed before. Well spotted, Marlene!

          Course of action:
          -Fix the affected surfaces.
          -Document the fix, and document the time period in which the surfaces were wrong.
          -Write an e-mail to the discussion list.

          I fully agree with that logic of course. However, 1) that functionality (i.e. reducepatch) was already there in ft_sourceplot, and 2) it has to be there, or at least, when the functionality is moved over to ft_sourceinterpolate, ft_sourceplot has to call ft_sourceinterpolate for adjusting the cortical mesh. Would the latter be preferred behavior?

I've added your mail below for bookkeeping.\n\n\n[FieldTrip] ft_sourceplot: issue with cfg.method = 'surface'\t12 april 2014 21:03\n\nDear fieldtrippers,\n\nDespite our best efforts, there has been an inconvenient bug in ft_sourceplot, which has been present in r9031-r9400 (Dec 13, 2013-April 12,2014). In particular, the images constructed when using cfg.method = 'surface' were incorrect. The issue pertains to the on-the-fly interpolation onto a cortical sheet of volumetrically (i.e. on a 3D grid) source-reconstructed data.\nI updated the cortical sheets last December, and replaced the handcrafted exemplars by the ones from the SPM surfrend toolbox. The motivation for all this would be to have a better reference to the actual data used. The bottom line of all this is that I made a mistake, and directly used the surfaces loaded from the Freesurfer file format, without taking into account the fact that in the Freesurfer convention the coordinate system in these files is slightly different than standard space. As a consequence these surfaces were misregistered to the 3D anatomical image in standard space, and thus to incorrect interpolations of the functional data onto these surfaces. \nThis issue has been identified thanks to Marlene Bönstrup and has been fixed today. Any sourceplots with cfg.method = 'surface' that have been made with FieldTrip versions originating from between the dates mentioned above will incorrectly represent the source reconstructed data, and may need to be re-done. More info can be found on http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/template/anatomy.\nI am very sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n\nBest wishes,\n\n Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen, MD PhD"
