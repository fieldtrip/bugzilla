        thetext: "@Ana & Cristiano: please team up and address these issues:\n\n\nDear fieldtrip community,\n\nthere seems to be a slight inconsistency in the tutorial section on artifact removal (which I otherwise like a lot because it calrifies a lot of the 'black-boxiness' of these particular fieldtrip functions (thanks a lot).\nThe part I am referring to is in the jump removal section. \n\nIt starts with the lines:\n\n\n% jump\ncfg                    = [];\nif isfield(cfg, 'padding') && cfg.padding~=0\npadding = cfg.padding;\nelse\npadding = 0;\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nDeal Fieldtrip users,\n\nthere is something else I do not understand in the tutorial: if you read in the data in trials (as it is done) how can you do padding later as it is suggested. I tried to run the example code on teh website  reading in the data such that it contains trials. If I then try to search for muscle artifacts I get the 'subscript indices must be positive or logical ... values', indicating that the code tries to access data that aren't there. If I set the padding to zero (instead of 0.1) it works. So I am wondering wether somehow one should actually run these things on continuous data (contrary to what is indicated in the tutorial)?\n\n\n\n\nThanks"
