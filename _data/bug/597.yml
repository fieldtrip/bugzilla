          at the moment the ft_read_header and other functions return channel names as sting which are 1-offset, whereas the meg160 software uses internally, BUT ALSO IN TH EUSER INTERFACE, uses 0-offset channel numbers and hence channel names.

          It would be more consistent to use the same names in both softwares

        thetext: "The naming of channels is an issue to be decided by Robert. Starting\nwith 0 would match the ET160 software (which ideally is not needed\nfor analysis anymore using FieldTrip), but starting with 0 always leads\nto confusion with respect to indices in Matlab, that start at 1. I\npersonally try to stay consistent within Matlab, i.e.,I suggest \nstarting with 001 in FiedlTrip."

          Hi everybody,

          This bug is still open. Following Matlab convention I
          would suggest not to change the indexing and start with
          1 for the Yokogawa systems. This is somewhat inconsistent
          as pointed out by the original submitter, but consistency
          within FieldTrip is probably more important. I will close
          the bug within two weeks if there is no further input.

          Yours, Till

          Hi everybody,

          There was consensus to keep the different indices:
          Channels start at 0 in the native Yokogawa Windows
          software, channels start at 1 in FieldTrip if Yokogawa
          data are read. Bug will be closed.

          Yours, Till
