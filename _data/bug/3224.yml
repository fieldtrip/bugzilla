        thetext: "Created attachment 820\nreduced data subset that still produces the error.\n\nI've encountered a small problem trying to calculate partial directed coherence (FT version 20160419).  When I run the code, I get the following warning:\n\nWarning: when performing non-parametric spectral factorization, the frequency axis should ideally start at 0, zero padding the spectral density \n\nAnd then the following error:\n\nError using zeros\nSize inputs must be integers.\n\nError in sfactorization_wilson (line 63)\n  S        = cat(3, zeros(size(S,1), size(S,1), npad), S);\n\n\nAfter some digging, I found that npad is not a whole number.  My frequency vector for the frequency analysis was 1:2:200, so npad is 1/2.  \n\nIn the short term, I can obviously redo the frequency analysis with a frequency vector starting at zero.  It would be great if the padding could either a) round npad appropriately or b) give a relevant error if the spectral factorization requires both a value for frequency zero AND regular frequency spacing.  I haven't had a chance to look too closely at the math to tell which of these solutions is appropriate.\n\nThe full dataset is too big to attach here, but I attached a smaller subset that still reliably produces the error.  If you run the following code, you should see it:\n\ncfg.method = 'pdc'; \npdcdata = ft_connectivityanalysis(cfg,csdfreq);\n\nThanks!"

        thetext: spectral factorization only works if the input frequency data indeed contains a valid frequency sampling. Typically, this should be 0:rayleighfrequency:Nyquist.

          I agree that some instructive error message would be useful.

          Please feel free to come with a suggestion: this can be best done through a pull request for the fieldtrip repo on github: https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip.git

          With respect to the padding I think that it's the user's responsibility to define an appropriate padding. In the context of npsf, the more the better (+multitaper smoothing)
