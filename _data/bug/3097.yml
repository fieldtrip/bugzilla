          ft_plot_dipole doesn't give any output, no figure handle. I want to plot a movie to show how a dipole changes both position and moment as a function of time. The problem consists that without a figure handle, all dipoles appear on the mri (using ft_plot_slice)

          Potential solution:
          In ft_plot_dipole, within lines 158-159 allow figure handles:
          h1=ft_plot_mesh(sphere, 'vertexcolor', 'none', 'edgecolor', false, 'facecolor', color);
          h2=ft_plot_mesh(stick,  'vertexcolor', 'none', 'edgecolor', false, 'facecolor', color);

          Problem:
          Do you know how to merge two figure handles?

        thetext: "without giving it a lot of thought, I would initially say that the ft_plot_xxx functions should not output a figure handle. Rather, they might have to output the handle (or handles) of the objects that they create. Those objects will have a parent, which has a parent, ... , which will lead to the axis and finally figure handle.\n\nIf ft_plot_dipole were to output a list of handles of the objects it creates, you could delete them (keeping the rest of the figure intact) and replace them with the dipole a fraction of a second later. \n\nI am just working on bug 3096, where I needed to plot the layout in two different styles (selected versus non-selected channels), and where I had to update the figure without clf or cla. If you look at \n\nhttps://github.com/robertoostenveld/fieldtrip/blob/bug3096/plotting/ft_plot_lay.m\n\nyou will see that it now outputs \"h\" which is a list (vector) of all handles. That includes the symbols/points, boxes, and text. Getting all of those handles organized required the same solution that you seem to be looking for.\n\nfor ft_plot_dipole that would correspond to returning the handles of the sphere and cylinder.\n\nit might be that\nh(1) = ft_plot_mesh(sphere,..)\nh(2) = ft_plot_mesh(cylinder,..)\nwould work, but more robust would be\n\nh1 = ft_plot_mesh(sphere,..)\nh2 = ft_plot_mesh(cylinder,..)\nh = cat(2, h1(:)', h2(:)');\n\nwhere it would also work if either one of the objects were to return multiple handles."
