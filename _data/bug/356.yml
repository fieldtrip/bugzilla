          There is a FieldTrip pipeline that creates a cortical mesh (source) using anatomical images of a subject with the help of FreeSurfer. However, this pipeline is working only on .mri data (because we know the coordinate system of this data). It would be useful if one could use other type of anatomical images as well.

          The pipeline has been written by Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen. More info by him, and here: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/minimum_norm_estimate_in_fieldtrip#source_space

          This is not exactly the case anymore. It should now work on any MRI in which the coordinate system is correctly described by the transformation matrix (and which I think should be right-handed).
