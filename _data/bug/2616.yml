          qstat reports Q->R->C and then teh job (after 12 hours at the DCCN) disappears

          if the job is not in stat any more, qsublist will not be able to determine the status, although e/o/mat file exist.

          I went over this last week with Marcel and revolved it. If the job cannot be found in qstat, then it will assume that the job is finished.

          ENH - deal with the exception that a job completed but that torque/maui don't have the job details any more (thanks to Marcel)



                switch backend
                  case 'torque'
                    [dum, jobstatus] = system(['qstat ' pbsid ' -f1 | grep job_state | grep -o "= [A-Z]" | grep -o "[A-Z]"']);
                    if isempty(jobstatus)
                      warning('cannot determine the status for pbsid %s', pbsid);
                      retval = 1;
                    else
                      retval = strcmp(strtrim(jobstatus) ,'C');
                    end
