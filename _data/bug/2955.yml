        thetext: "Stephen ran into some issues with a cortical sheet with color-coded functional data on it. It occurred to me that for those we only have opacity, whereas for line and vector (ER and TFR) we also have saturation. That is used as cfg.maskstyle in the top-level plotting functions. \n\nWe might also implement saturation as alternative for meshes in ft_plot_mesh and for slices in ft_plot_slice.m"

          It should be implemented both in ft_plot_mesh and (higher up) in ft_sourceplot
