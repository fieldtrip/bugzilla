        thetext: "I am closing this bug because the development on the fieldtrip/peer toolbox will be put onto hold in favor of the fieldtrip/qsub toolbox. The qsub toolbox is more promising for the DCCN as a whole and hence requires attention. \n\nThe peer toolbox will remain available within fieldtrip, and external contributions to the  code will be considered for inclusion.\n\nIn the future, the development on fieldtrip/peer may be started up again and the bugs that I hereby close as \"wontfix\" can be revisited."
