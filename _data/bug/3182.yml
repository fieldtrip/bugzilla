          Cecilia reported this by email:

          I am doing a frequency analysis (induced gamma activity) on MEG data and I was wondering whether it makes a difference to select cfg. keeptrials = 'yes' in the analysis.

          What I thought is that keeping the trials in ft_freqanalysis and then averaging using ft_freqdescriptives would lead to the same result as using cfg.keeptrials= 'no'. Am I correct?

          I am getting quite different TFRs representation actually, especially in the baseline. (by using cfg.keeptrials='no' , TFRs are somewhat "cleaner")..

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #0)

          I suspect it is due to her plotting it differently, and/or baseline correcting it differently. But let's check to be suyre

          I tested it, there is no difference between keeptrials=yes or no.
