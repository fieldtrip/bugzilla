          The fwd module needs some reorganization and some definition of priorities /preferences in the routines that build the volume conductor.
          Several possibilities are available for each input-method combination.
          A matrix representing the input/fwd methods help in understanding what has to be implemented, what is already there, waht could be implemented, what is definitely not interesting to implement.
