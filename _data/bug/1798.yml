          Running various source localization functions run into the following error. I changes my heap java memory as well as the recursion limit. As promised, the latter just makes matlab crash. Otherwise, it doesn't make a difference. Running the functions on an older (month old) fieldtrip version works.

          %%%%%%%%%%

          ??? Maximum recursion limit of 500 reached. Use set(0,'RecursionLimit',N)
          to change the limit.  Be aware that exceeding your available stack space can
          crash MATLAB and/or your computer.

          Error in ==> ft_voltype

          or in the following case:

          ??? Maximum recursion limit of 500 reached. Use set(0,'RecursionLimit',N)
          to change the limit.  Be aware that exceeding your available stack space can
          crash MATLAB and/or your computer.

          Error in ==> ft_datatype_headmodel

          %%%%%%%%%%%%%

          All these must be very recent changes - since I was using the same scripts last friday. Trouble shooting those turns out to be tricky due to yet another buggy behavior: typing 'edit' in order to edit just about anything leads to an error - a situation resolved when the 'External' folder from the fieldtrip folder is excluded from the path.
