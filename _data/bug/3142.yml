          Last weekend two people asked questions on the discussion list that in the end are related to coordinate system issues, and which are most likely user errors. This is a recurring topic and somehow explaining it again and again does not stick.
          One way to be more informative towards the user is to more explicitly and consistently use a coordsys field in data objects that contain geometric information in 3D space:

          -grad/elec
          -headmodel
          -sourcemodel
          -source
          -mri -> this one has it, but as far as I know, the others don't.


          1) Having it in grad/elec, headmodel, sourcemodel also allows for an explicit check of consistency of coordinate systems (and goes beyond the metrical units).

          2) Having it in sourcemodel, and let it percolate to source structures, allows for checking it against the coordsys in the mri-structure (or the cortical (template) sheet) prior to doing the interpolation. Throwing an error at a mismatch in coordinate systems (which is probably the cause of Vitoria's and Andreas' problems) at least makes the user aware of the fact the coordinate systems should match.

          Note that point 2 pertains to bug 2032 as well.

        thetext: "related to bug #2032 I have added it to the template data for the atlasses (the ones stored in *.mat format) and to the anatomical surfaces. The inflated surfaces don't have coordsys, but should also not be interpreted geometrically.  \n\nFurthermore, I have added a check for coordsys consistency in ft_sourceplot. That uses a helper function \"fixcoordsys\" to handle the spm/mni ambiguity. \n\nDo you know of other concrete actions that can be taken to further resolve this issue? If not, I suggest we close it."
