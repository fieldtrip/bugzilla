          There is a bugzilla for the neurodebian project. Within that project a fieldtri ppackage will be made. To facilitate interaction between the neurodebian project and the fieldtrip project, the two bugzilla systems should be linked.

          Note that we first have to wait for the package and the associated debian infrastructure to be constructed, so this bug has to wait a bit. I expect the package to be finished somewhere in Q1/2011.

          What exactly is meant by "linked". AFAIK bugzilla sites are independent of each other, so linking is basically a manual operation. When a bug is filed on neurodebian for fieldtrip, should it just send an e-mail to the fieldtrip-bugs list?

          Should it be the other way around as well?

          I suppose it makes sense to let the neurodebian bugzilla post to fieldtrip-bugs for each fieldtrip bug, but not automatically the other way around. When a bug is filed on this bugzilla and it is already a known bug on the neurodebian bugzilla, it makes sense to include that bug in the CC list manually, but I don't see a way to do that automatically.
