          Sensor Connectivity matrix

          When I generate connectivity matrices for Yokogawa KIT files, the matrices have each sensor as its own neighbor. This was done using the triangulation method. According to the documentation, this should not be the case.

          I've attached a matrix for my system. I had to change the labels from AG to MEG to make it compatible for mne-python.

          Hi Teon,

          I don't know what kind of system yours is. It seems to have 208 channels, which I have not seen before. There is mention of the system on http://mailman.science.ru.nl/pipermail/fieldtrip/2014-October/008518.html

          If you look in ft_senstype, there is explicit mention of 9, 64, 160 and 440 channel yokogawa systems. I would not be sure whether channel types are correctly detected. Hence I am also not sure whether channel neighbours can be correctly detected. It is also not mentioned on http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/getting_started/yokogawa

          I suggest you manually craft your neighbours, since you know best which channels are to be considered neighbours.

          If you want the system to be better supported in FieldTrip, you will have to share more details and a (preferably small) datafile with us.
