          I noticed that with the large plotting overhaul, it failed for labelcmb data. The error was detected in test_old_ft_singleplotTFR.m

          I have made some changes to fix it.

          I wrote a test function that plots various representations of connectivity data (directed measure), using ft_topoplotER/ft_singleplotER.

          To me, all looks OK, including the highlighting. I have no reason to suspect any issues with TFR type data, and I won't spend time on this right now (since it also rarely occurs).
