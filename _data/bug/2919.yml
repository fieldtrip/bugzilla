          Preparing for the FT workshop in Barcelona I found out that with MATLAB 2014b the "click on a sensor to see its label" functionality in ft_prepare_neighbours does not work any more. Perhaps this is due to the changes in GUI handles.

          It can be reproduced with the eventrelatedaveraging tutorial data and

          cfg                 = [];
          cfg.feedback        = 'yes';
          cfg.method          = 'template';
          cfg.neighbours      = ft_prepare_neighbours(cfg, avgFIC);

          and then click on a channel (nothing happens).

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
