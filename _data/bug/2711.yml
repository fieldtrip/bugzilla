          It is about this loop in ft_math (causing errors in line 361).

          keepfield = {'grad', 'elec'};
          for j=1:numel(keepfield)
            if isfield(varargin{i}, keepfield{j})
              keep = true;
              tmp = varargin{i}.(keepfield{j});
            else
              keep = false;
            end
            for i=1:numel(varargin)
              if ~isequal(varargin{i}.(keepfield{j}), tmp)
                keep = false;
                break
              end
            end
            if keep
              data.(keepfield{j}) = tmp;
            end
          end

          For me, it crashes because I have no fields called 'elec'. After checking whether there is a field called varargin{i}.elec (returning 0), it goes on to the statement "if ~isequal(varargin{i}.(keepfield{j}), tmp)" which crashes because of a reference to non-existent field 'elec'.

          I think breaking from the loop at the isfield bit would work, right?

          Best,

          Maarten

          edit:
          Coming to think of it, that probably wouldn't work, but you get the idea.

          something like this.
