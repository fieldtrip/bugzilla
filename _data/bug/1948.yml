          This is the case for, and possibly others:
          - singlespheres
          - singleshell
          - localspheres
          As found under /data/test/vol/*.*.


          Currently, the only check performed in ft_datatype to check if input is a volume is:
          isvolume =  isfield(data, 'transform') && isfield(data, 'dim');

          Which yields a false for the volumes above, and possibly others.

        thetext: As an in between fix, ft_voltype (bug 1940) now checks whether the input explicitly is a grad or sens structure, and skips the first volumness-check. When ft_dataype is updated, an explicit check should be made for volumeminity of the input in ft_voltype (and the isgrad and iselec reference should be removed).

          1 there is an essential difference between a volume structure and a vol structure.
          the latter is the volume conduction model, which has a specific type that can be recovered with ft_voltype. The former is a 3D numeric matrix containing data defined in 3D space, always with a dim and transform field.

          2 the original bug probably still is a bug.

          solution: adjust ft_transform_geometry to first check what type of data is in the input, and only call ft_voltype when the input is a vol-structure.

          this is related to bug 1940, reported by Vladimir.

          Also checkrotation was by majority vote considered to not be well-named.

        thetext: "I changed my changes to ft_voltype to be less confusing. The isgrad/issens check was appropriate there, but the documentation was confusing/confused. \n\nThe original bug (bug 1940, error when rescaling a sens) was (indirectly) fixed by my previous changes. I think. The confusing bit is that in the doc of ft_transform_geometry it is stated that an electrode structure (e.g. 'sens') should not be rescaled. Yet, inside, only a check for ft_senstype(input,'meg') is done. So, which is it? \nAre electrode arrays allowed to be rescaled? Ft_transform_sens also says, only MEG should be rigid body, EEG is fine. If yes, than the original bug was fixed. \n\nIf the answer to the above is yes, I propose to change the check in ft_transform_geometry to the following:\n************\n% flg rescaling check\nallowscaling = ~ft_senstype(input, 'meg'); \n\n...\n\nif ~allowscaling\n  if abs(det(rotation)-1)>100*eps  % allow for some numerical imprecision\n    error('only a rigid body transformation without rescaling is allowed');\n  end\nend\n\nif allowscaling\n  % FIXME build in a check for uniform rescaling probably do svd or so\n  % FIXME insert check for nonuniform scaling, should give an error\nend \n************\n\nConfusingly, the current code states\n~strcmp(ft_voltype(input),'unknown')) ---> don't allow rescaling\nIf I understand it correctly, volume conductor models should be rescalable (last sentence of documentation)..."
