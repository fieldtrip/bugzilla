          There is a bug in the way the caching of the header info for the biosig data is done in read_biosig_data (in the private folder of the fileio), which can cause wrong data to be read without you knowing it when you read several data files after each other.
          I think the problem is dir(filename) in line 35 and 43, because this gives an emty structure (on windows and mac). To quickly fix the problem I have removed the dir and just use filename instead. But I'm not sure this solution works in all cases.

          I've looked a bit deeper into the bug and found out that it happens because I use a filename only (so not with the full directory before it). I now see in the help of the definetrial that you should specifiy the full directory. (I always added the path of the file) So the problem will not happpen to people who read the help functions very good ;), but maybe it is good to build a check around the input of the filename, so this will not happen to anyone else!
          Sorry for bothering you with my stupid mistakes!
