          In light of the Stockholm workshop ft_scalpcurrentdensity is used on a combined MEG-EEG dataset stripped of the MEG data. The grad structure, however, still remains in the dataset. ft_scalpcurrentdensity does not allow datasets containing a grad structure:

          115 | % check if the input data is valid for this function
          116 | data = ft_checkdata(data, 'datatype', 'raw', 'feedback', 'yes', 'ismeg', 'no');

          One possible solution is to replace the error with a warning. Users should be aware that this function should not be used on MEG data but in the end users are responsible for the correct input data.

          Another solution would be to remove the grad field at the step where the EEG data is extracted and the MEG data removed. In this case using ft_preprocessing with cfg.channel = 'EEG';

        thetext: "ft_checkdata should have both ismeg=yes/no/empty and iseeg=yes/no/empty. These are not mutually exclusive. \n\nNote that ismeg=no is only to be used when we know that an algorithm does not work for MEG. In general the common options for ismeg are 'yes' and [].\n\nThe error should remain as is."

        thetext: oh, the specific bug is to be addressed by iseeg=yes, and ismeg=[] as requirements for  ft_scalpcurrendensity.

        thetext: ok, that solves the main issue. ft_scalpcurrentdensity now crashes because ft_fetch_sens reads out the grad information, not the elec information. Unlike ft_read_sens, ft_fetch_sens does not have a senstype option. Should I implement such an option?

        thetext: ft_fetch_sens doesn't even recognize it as having eeg data as ft_senstype, in an if-then statement, first looks for the presence of a grad field. Currently, ft_fetch_sens should throw an error if both a grad and elec field are present. This does not happen, however, as iseeg currently cannot be true in the presence of a grad field.

          Discussed in ft-meeting:
          change ft_senstype to be non-mutually exclusive.

          implement senstype in ft_fetch_sens as in ft_read_sens
