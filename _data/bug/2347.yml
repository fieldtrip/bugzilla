          Hi Julian,

          I suspect the problem being with the dipoli executable. Can you see (based on the screen output) that it is running? It might be that it cannot find the executable on your path, or that the executable has linked-library requirements not met on your Ubuntu 12.04 machine.

          Robert

          Hi Robert,

          thanks for your quick reply.
          When running ft_headmodel_dipoli in debug mode, I set the mex-file in line 134ff to the correct dipoli.glnx86.
          Double checking by hand also gives the right path:

          K>> which dipoli.glnx86
          /home/keil/data/programs/Matlab/fieldtrip-20131028/external/dipoli/dipoli.glnx86

          However, in line 190, I get:
          K>> dos(exefile);
          /tmp/tpbdbb2888_e1fc_4b4a_ba1e_3e0af3a8689d.sh: 3: /tmp/tpbdbb2888_e1fc_4b4a_ba1e_3e0af3a8689d.sh: /home/keil/data/programs/Matlab/fieldtrip-20131028/external/dipoli/dipoli.glnx86: not found

          So, I assume executing the dipoli.glnx86 fails.
          Is there a way around this?

          Or otherwise, what program would you recommend to build a EEG BEM-Model? Currently, I'm the only one with a Mac in my group, the rest uses Ubuntu 12.04 or different versions of Windows.

          note that it is not a mex file, but a command line executable. Could you do the following on the linux command line?

          cd /home/keil/data/programs/Matlab/fieldtrip-20131028/external/dipoli/
          ./dipoli.glnx86  # i.e. try to run it
          ldd dipoli.glnx86 # i.e. show the libs it depends on

          AH!
          I think I might have found the solution.
          The .glnx86 was compiled on a 32-bit system. I have a 64-bit system.
          Installing sudo apt-get install ia32-libs at least lets me run the executable.

          I'll get back to you if I get it to run from matlab.

          Installing the ia32-library in fact did the job.
          Thanks a lot for the super fast help and pointing me to the problem.

          Best,

          thanks for tracking it down.

          Could you perhaps add a few lines of 32/64 bit documentation to this related faq?

        thetext: "Hi Robert,\nI just ran into this problem myself now.  The problem was traced to that the .ama file was never created.  I see Julian's solution (thanks Julian!) of installing the ia32-library.   Sadly, this will take my IT support about 5-10 working days to get around to solving as I just filed the 'helpdesk' request now (as they don't grant us 'sudo' rights).  \n\nI wondered if FieldTrip could provide the version of 'dipoli' compiled on 64 bit Linux for everyone, as 64bit is more and more common these days?\n\nI reopened the bug but feel free to reclose.\n\nThank you,\nJohanna"

          Hi Johanna,

          Sorry for only getting back to this so late.

          I don't have the dipole source code so cannot recompile on new platforms.
