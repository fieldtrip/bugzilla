          A script which I've been using to search the same dataset for several different types of artifact (using ft_artifact_xxx) suddenly didn't work anymore, producing the below error.

          ??? Undefined function or method 'sum' for input arguments of type 'cell'.

          Error in ==> ft_artifact_zvalue at 276
                sumval = sumval + sum(dat,2);

          To make sure this was reproducible, I downloaded the sample artifact dataset from http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/automatic_artifact_rejection and attempted to follow the tutorial there. ft_artifact_zvalue failed with the same error message.

          I am using fieldtrip from inside the donders, and this error occurred both on a mentat and on my windows PC.

          I note that the artifact rejection tutorial opens with a statement to the effect that ft_artifact_xxx functions will soon become obsolete. Although my script calls ft_artifact_xxx, the tutorial calls ft_artifact_zvalue directly and fails with an identical error, so I don't think that's where the problem lies.

          Hi Tom,

          My bad. I copied and pasted some stuff which was obviously not correct.

          I'll fix it right away. Should be available again in the coming 30 minutes or so.
          For the time being you could specify cfg.memory = 'low', which makes the function slower, but probably resistant against the issue.

          Apologies again.

          JM
