        thetext: "(Sorry, this is not a bug ;)\n\n\nDear Robert,\n\nI am writing to you in reference to the connectivity analysis software (HERMES) we presented at the Biomag.\n\nAs I said to you in Paris, we are very happy to collaborate with you, if you find interesting to include Hermes in Fieldtrip. Our software mainly analyses connectivity between signals with many different methods, and has the option of computing statistics between the groups and conditions of the project, through a very easy to use GUI.\nHermes does have the option to import data directly from fieldtrip, as ft is the most used tool to analyse neurophysiological data nowadays! ;) So this point together with the intuitive interface, could be interesting for working together and reach another portion of the scientists. Perhaps as you have a broader vision of the field, you have some other ideas in mind. As you commented, it also would be possible to readapt our functions to the fieldtrip format.\n\nI am open to share ideas, and available to describe our project in more detail if you are interested at any point.\nThe paper in which we present it, its under review at NeuroInformatics. We hope to have a positive answer soon. And perhaps, if you don't mind we could send you the manuscript.\n\nHope to talk soon.\n\nEnjoy these days and have a happy new year :)\n\nAll the best,\n\nguiomar\n\n-- \nJulia Guiomar Niso Galán\n\nCentro de Tecnología Biomédica (CTB)\nParque Científico y Tecnológico de la UPM\nCampus de Montegancedo\n28223 Pozuelo de Alarcón, Madrid, ES\n\nguiomar.niso@ctb.upm.es"

          Is there anybody who would like to push this forward? If so, I suggest that somebody on the HERMES-end takes this on. I guess one thing that can be done, is that HERMES will support fieldtrip-style data structures.

          This would require a fieldtrip2hermes (and for symmetry purposes) a hermes2fieldtrip function (a bit in style of eeglab2fieldtrip (in fieldtrip/external/eeglab), or spm2fieldtrip (in fieldtrip-main)

          If this is not an active line of investment, I suggest to close this bug.
