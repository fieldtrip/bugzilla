          Hey Lilla,

          afair, inflated surfaces are supported. I started with re-organizing the function - it can be found under private/moviefunction.m (this one definitely works with inflated surfaces). Feel free to play around with it, but it's not finished yet. The new version cannot save the movie atm, but the old version should be able to do it. Anyway, I'll work on the new version the next weeks, so hopefully all your requests will be implemented soon ;)
