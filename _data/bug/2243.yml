          Created attachment 660
          transcrip and presentation of the fieldtrip intro 'lecture'.

          Most likely I will not make this video anymore during my short remaining time at the Donders (sad smiley face goes here). The text and presentation should be on \\dccn-qnap001\fieldtrip but I cannot access the network drive currently. Thus, I uploaded the transcript and the corresponding presentation here and assign this bug back to the joint developer.

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
