          The timreq is not correct in the line

          peerslave[14745]: executing job 1 from robert@MacBook.local (jobid=1256252011, memreq=1234, timreq=0)


          this corresponds to line 470 in peerslave.c

          DEBUG(LOG_CRIT, "executing job %d from %s@%s (jobid=%u, memreq=%lu, timreq=%d)", ++jobnum, job->host->user, job->host->name, job->job->id, job->job->memreq, job->job->timreq);

          but I don't understand what the problem is :-(

        thetext: "I am closing this bug because the development on the fieldtrip/peer toolbox will be put onto hold in favor of the fieldtrip/qsub toolbox. The qsub toolbox is more promising for the DCCN as a whole and hence requires attention. \n\nThe peer toolbox will remain available within fieldtrip, and external contributions to the  code will be considered for inclusion.\n\nIn the future, the development on fieldtrip/peer may be started up again and the bugs that I hereby close as \"wontfix\" can be revisited."
