I would like to know\n(a) Is it a new feature in version fieldtrip-20120409? If yes, is there any function call to retrieve nSamples?\n(b) the ft_read_header() of version fieldtrip-20120409 seems to take much more memory resource than that of version fieldtrip-20120109. I cannot run newer versions on a Windows PC equipped with 3GB RAM, but the same PC can run version fieldtrip-20120109 smoothly. Are there any parameters that I can pass to the newer ft_read_header() to reduce memory usage?\n\nThanks."

        thetext: "Hi Paul,\n\nThanks for the report. The output of ft_read_header should provide the right output now. \n\n\nIn some cases, the orig.header.numsamples = 0, and the output number of samples is wrong. In the previous version of loadcnt.m the orig.header.nums field was used (instead of numsamples). This was changed in r5380 to fix bug 1348. This bug was due to loadcnt.m being updated to the most recent version (from neuroscan), which removed the nums field, in favor of using numsamples. \nI added a workaround for when numsamples is 0. The reason is unknown to me (it looks like a neuroscan data-file specific bug). I re-added the nums field to loadcnt.m so that it can be used in ft_read_header.m.\n\nRobert, I added you to the CC in case I missed something here (you performed r5380). The only reason I can see when the output should actually be 0, is when the datafile is empty, which would result in many other errors, so the workaround should be fine I think."

          Hi Roemer, thanks for picking this up. The loadcnt function is shared with EEGLAB, or better: we just use the EEGLAB version. Earlier this year Arno informed us that the function was updated in EEGLAB and that therefore we also might want to update our copy

          So making changes to only our copy of loadcnt is not ideal. I'll CC Arno on this bug...

          @Arno, could the h.nums be added to the EEGLAB copy of loadcnt as well?

          Please see http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/diff?spec=svn5806&r=5806&format=side&path=/trunk/fileio/private/loadcnt.m
          for the change that Roemer made.

          Or is there another header field we should use to determine the number of samples. Or (probably better) should the fix be in numsamples?

          Right now the fieldtrip version of loadcnt returns

          >> hdr.orig.header.numsamples
          ans =
               0

          >> hdr.orig.header.nums
          ans =
               1505200

        thetext: Based on the 8 test datasets for bug 1490 it seems that right now header.nums always contains the right value (this is with the modification that Roemer made to loadcnt), whereas numsamples is not always correct.

        thetext: there are two bugs related to neuroscan cnt, bug 1412 and bug 1490. My proposed solution (discussed with Vladimir over skype) is to move fieldtirp/fileio/private/loadcnt.m to fieldtrip/external/eeglan and merge it with the "official" eeglab version. That ensures that the flow of teh code and changes ot the code can be better tracked.

          I have resolved the loadcnt issue as commented. Also see the comment in bug 1490, svn revision 8519 and revision 8526.
