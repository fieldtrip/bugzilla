          Hi Stephen,

          Thanks for reporting! I changed a call to size(x,2) to numel when determining ntrials, that should fix it if you had data.trail cell-array as a trialx1 array (don't know why it wasn't like this in the first place). Does that fix it for you?

          BTW, the dpss part using variable time-windows is still not perfect. I haven't looked into it yet, but there is quite some difference to the old implementation in some cases. For Hanning windows it seems fine atm, but I am hoping for confirmation from other.

          Cheers,
          Roemer

I'm not really sure, could be somewhere in deeper code...\n\nCheers,\nRoemer"
