          plots

          I was doing DICS in my data and I notice that for some contrasts the functional activations fell at the skull. To check it out, I run the test_tutorial_beamforming_extended.m to see how the plot looked like and see the attached image and compare it with the tutorial one:

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/beamformingextended#plotting_cortico-muscular_coherent_sources

          I don't know since when but in some cases activations are outside the brain. Could somebody give a hint about where should I dig first?

        thetext: looks fine to me, Diego! Given the limited spatial resolution of the source reconstruction method it is fine to observe 'outside' brain activations (particular close to the neocortical surface. I wouldn't list this as a bug. It is just a feature of the algorithms we use.

          Thanks Jan-Mathijs. But then why the current plot blob it's more at the skull in comparison with tutorial's figure? This was the main reason I thought might be something is not working...

          Discussed at FT-meeting 22/01/2014: it seems that the discrepancy is caused by the fact that the current figures have been generated with the old-style template grids, whereas the new template grids are defined on slightly different positions.
          I suggest to replace the figures in the tutorial(s). Diego, would you mind taking this bug and doing this?

          Changed http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/beamformingextended?&#plotting_cortico-muscular_coherent_sources


          BTW, What to do with the old figures? I don't know how to delete them in case we've to
