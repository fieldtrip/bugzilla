          note that

          1) the use of ~ as output argument is not in line with http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/guidelines/code#ensure_that_it_runs_on_older_matlab_versions

          2) the ft_volumerealign function has an internal subfunction that goes under the name icp2, but it does not seem to be used. Perhaps it can be removed.

           3) the local beer in Stockholm is quite nice

          4) I don't understand why this works for the hcp. But that might be due to the beer.

          (In reply to comment #2)

          @1: You're right. I changed the number of outputs to icp, to get some additional diagnostic information from this function easily available. I guess I forgot to commit this change to the repository. Will do this.

          @2: Yes, I'll remove it.

          @3: The wodka in St.Petersburg was nice too.


          @4): Neither do I, but it could be due to the fact that I copied a locally compiled version of the executable to chpc...

          I updated fieldtrip/external/fileexchange/icp.m and removed the subfunctions from ft_volumerealign.
          Should work now. Could you give it a try?
