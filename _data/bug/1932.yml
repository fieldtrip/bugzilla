          Created attachment 406
          test_fairsurface.m

          I ran into this problem by calling ft_prepare_mesh with a headshape of 21285 .pnt but no .tri and with a cfg.numvertices 3000.  See attached script test_fairsurface.m.

          On line 241 of prepare_mesh_headshape (which is actually a line within the subfunction fairsurface), the difference between desired and existing points is computed, which if 0, then the weighting param w_i is NaN and the new points created into XYZmm_o are NaN rather than adjusted.

Is this ok with the intended output?  I tried finding the original file on which fairsurface was based in SPM8, to see if that file had any updates, but coudln't find it."
