        thetext: When calling ft_stratify multiple times simultaneously (e.g. when using torque), it returns an error when too many Curve Fitting Toolboxes are used. This seems to be caused by calling of randperm.m.

          Hoi Stan,
          I am fairly sure that randperm is *not* a function in the curve fitting toolbox, so I doubt that your diagnosis of the problem you encountered is correct :-). You are not by any chance doing any fancy gamma frequency peak detection in your matlab-script, fitting gaussians to spectra?
          Note that yesterday there where some issues with the stability of the torque cluster, which by now should have been resolved. I am not sure, but this may have been a cause, too. Could you try again and get back to us if your problem persists, otherwise close the issue?

          JM, you might be right that it had to do with torque. I got the error before the torque-rollback yesterday. I could not copy the exact error unforunately, because my session was terminated due to the version-rollback.
          Today, I cannot replicate the error, so as for now, I will close the bug.

          License checkout failed.
          License Manager Error -4
          I've reopened the bug, because I am getting the same error again. To me, it seems to be caused by randperm?

It might be that the license server is incorrectly configured.\n\nI suggest you report it to the TG."
