          When the left/right arrow keys are used in ft_databrowser to browse trials for artifacts and are pressed quickly (usually before the trial data is plotted, but not always), the wrong trial can get displayed. Try this:

          1.) Start at trial 1
          2.) Press the right arrow key quickly 5 times.
          3.) Wait for data to load. Trial 6 will be displayed.
          4.) Press the right arrow key one more time.
          5.) Trial 7 will not be displayed. Actual trial displayed depends on how queued events were handled. Mine went to Trial 3.

          Not confirmed on other hardware/OS. My environment info:
          Mac OS X 10.8.5
          Matlab R2013b

          Thanks for reporting!

          Fixed in bug 3123, current bug marked as duplicate.

          (technically it's the other way around ;), but I hadn't spotted this bug yet.)

          *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 3123 ***
