          Created attachment 23
          Example .sqd file with 2 types of trigger on channels 167 and 168

          Since some time, I try to use fieldtrip to analyze MEG obtained from a KIT MEG machine with 157 gradial axiometers (Yokogawa format). While reading the proprietary .sqd format works fine, importing events or trials consistently fails.
          In total, the resulting .sqd data files consist of 192 channels, 157 of which contain MEG data, the rest are trigger and denoising-channels.

          In the attached test.sqd file, there are 2 different trial types, and 123 trials.
          Trials are indexed on channels 162:169; i.e. triggers are defined by the channel number of which there is a trigger signal. Trigger signals are 5ms spikes, sent from the presentation computer. In the test.sqd file, there are triggers on channel 168 (many) and on 167 (few).

          The ft_read_event(cfg.dataset) command never finds any events, nor is there any obvious way to read in trials or trial times in fieldtrip.

          Any help is greatly appreciated!

Nevertheless FieldTrip can read the\nevents from those channels, you just have to tell it about the channels.\nI have created and attached a little demo script extracting events,\nand calculating an average over one type of event and displaying field\nmaps. The main points is that you input the trigger channel indices into\nft_read_event. The attached code could be simplified using ft_definetrial,\nbut the demo code shows better, what is actually happening. A last and\nvery important issue: Channel indices in KIT / Yokogawa start at 0 and\ngo to 159, in Matlab it is 1 to 160, therefore your trigger channels\n167 and 168 become indices 168 and 169 in FieldTrip.\n\nYours, Till"
