          fixed upon revision 8380.

          Note: are there any other places in FT that try to feval a non-prefixed function?

          (In reply to comment #1)

          There are trialfuns, browsefuns and low-level freq stuff. I think that those have all been dealt with.

          Looking at ft_definetrial, I see at line 140
            cfg.trialfun = ft_getuserfun(cfg.trialfun, 'trialfun');

          See private/ft_getuserfun.m

          I think the desired implementation is to use ft_getuserfun also for the feval in ft_rejectartifact.
