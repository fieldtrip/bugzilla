        thetext: "I created an ft_plot_patch, similar to ft_plot_vector (its base). It's currently relatively simple, but allows for plotting SEMS etc in the local axis systems that we use.\n\nIt can also be used as a replacement for ft_plot_box.\n\nI remember vaguely we at some point decided not to created such a function, but I forgot why. Anybody remember? \n\nWasn't a lot of work, feel free to shoot it down."

        thetext: "I don't recall arguments for not making the function, except that (possibly) at that time I did not see the need for it. I do see the need for it now, although for one possible use case (confidence intervals) there is possible some intersection with the highlighting option in ft_plot_vector (and ft_plot_matrix).\n\nIt would be good to further integrate it with the other plotting tools, e.g. have ft_plot_box be a simple call to ft_plot_patch. We could also add the  \n'confidence' and 'confidencestyle' options to ft_plot_vector to allow specification of a 2xN matrix with the lower and upper confidence intervals (c.f. plotting the mean and SEM)."
