          searching for "fieldtrip" used to result in a first place, now it is nowhere to be found

          "fieldtrip meg" ends up with a NIH site as the first hit (from a collaborator).
          "fieldtrip eeg" also ends up with lots of sites that relate to us, but not ours.
          "fieldtrip donders" and "fieldtrip nijmegen" end up on the download page, not the front page.

          overal the results are weird and suggest a configuration problem (e.g. not allowing the site to be spidered)

          hmm, the page source on the start page shows
          <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />

          and http://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html
          suggests that to be a problem for us.

        thetext: that meta tag is definitely not good; maybe it slipped in there when I changed the template. will fix ASAP.

          This had nothing to do with the new template; rather, it was the 'indexdelay' setting (http://www.dokuwiki.org/config:indexdelay) in dokuwiki's configuration manager. I have set this to 0, thereby removing the noindex,nofollow tag.

          However, this meta tag must have been there already when the new template was installed, so I am not quite sure this is the cause of the worse search results. The setting might have been reset by the latest dokuwiki upgrade (which occurred after the template change), though. Let's wait and see what the effect on search results is.
