          Hello Robert,
          I'm using the fieldtrip ft_read_event function to read in the Events.nev files our (Thilo's really) Neuralynx system generates. However, we are using two different ports for our Events and I would need not only the information about the value, but also about the port back from the function.
          I made changes to the function, which would do this, but maybe that can be added to the fieldtrip functions, such that I would not need to make sure to always use the changed version. I send you my changes as suggestion. I don't know whether you might want to do it in a nicer way.
          I added two new lines after line 1319, one of them containing a new function. And I made changes in the original line 1325.


          Best,
          Stephanie

          P.S. I don't have the newest version of fieldtrip, so may be that functionality is already added somewhere, but I checked the logfile for that and I didn't see it there.
