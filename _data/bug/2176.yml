          I compared the two "relevant" mrprot files and I think that one of these two parameters causes the problem:

          (1) VD13 file: "ucReconstructionMode	 		= 	1"
          In the VD13 version the parameter "ucReconstructionMode" is in decimal notation, while in VB17 it is in hexadecimal notation ("ucReconstructionMode                     = 0x1")

          (2) VD13 has an additional parameter ## alTR.__attribute__.size = 128:
          that could be mistaken to be the original VB17 parameter: "alTR[0] = 2320000"
          In the VD13 file the parameter alTR[0] also exists

I don't know the details of the expected compile environment (i.e. the development environment that Stefan used), but we can look at that together. I guess it involves mingw and fltk."
