        thetext: "Mail on the mailinglist\n    Dear All,\n\n    after running source statistics I tried to plot the result. However, I\n    always get the error that cfg.parameter 'all' can't be used since there is\n    \"no such field\".\n\n \n\n\n    I know that I can also specify single parameters, i.e. only the ones I want\n    to interpolate. However, I would like to know why it doesn't work for me\n    with all the parameters... Maybe it's only a minor thing, i.e. the FT\n    version. But I want to make sure that there is no major error in my\n    pipeline.\n\n    Any help is as always very appreciated! Thanks!\n\n    Best,\n\n    Andreas\n\nHe also stated:\nHowever, it would be good to know why 'all' does not work, since it is described in the tutorial..."
