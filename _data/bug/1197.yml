It's just that every other channels is practically flat (actually switches between two values with a small difference).\n\nVladimir\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nHello\n\nI got your contact info from colleagues at the Cyclotron research centre in Liege, and am hoping you can help with a problem we have encountered in trying to read Neuroscan .cnt files in SPM8 eeg. \n\nOur colleague Caroline Schnakers has been importing .cnt files without problems using Neuroscan 4.2. We are using Neurocan 4.5 and are encountering problems in converting the files. When opening the file only every second channel appears in SPM. \n\n\nThank you very much\n\nMarianne Løvstad\n\n-- \nMarianne Løvstad\nPsykologspesialist/Ph.d. student \nSunnaas sykehus\ntlf: + 47 93 45 20 03"

        thetext: this has the characteristics of a 16 versus 32 bit problem, which has been an issue with neuroscan files before.

          Oh yes, it's that again. I didn't think so at first because I thought that at the time we got complete rubbish with the wrong setting but yes, nothing new here.

        thetext: This bug has been known for a long time. The reason for it is that there is no way (at least that we know of) to determine whether the data file is 16-bit or 32-bit. This needs to be specified manually by the user. Perhaps it's worth checking whether there is now any code around that can solve it, but if not that's just how it is.
