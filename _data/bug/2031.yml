          Created attachment 434
          screenshot of figure

          The following code

          cfg = [];
          cfg.xlim = [-0.2 : 0.1 : 1.0];  % Define 12 time intervals
          cfg.zlim = [-2e-13 2e-13];      % Set the 'color' limits.
          clf;
          ft_topoplotER(cfg,avgFIC);

          from the eventrelatedaveraging tutorial causes the FieldTrip menu item (in the figure) to be added multiple times (once per subplot).

          fixed in 7667.

          Note that I added the fix to topoTFR and topoER separately, as that is where the menu code was. Should this be moved to topoplot_common? Also, what should the behaviour be of the menu if subplots are used which refer to different data sets? Something to think about.

          should we in that case do something like:

          - if the menu item exists when making the 2nd (or further) subplots, remove it or hide it?
          - or, if it detects that the plot is made in a subplot, then don't add it?

          Yes, I think it should be removed for subplots. But this is less trivial than it might seem: we *do* want the menu there in cases like this

          figure;
          ft_topoplotER(cfg, data);
          ...
          ft_topoplotER(cfg, data);

          so when there is a plotting call without a new figure. So we cannot simply check the tag associated with gcf.

          In case of subplots you could change the label (and handle) of the uimenu items to correspond to the subplot/dataset. In any case, perhaps it is worth adding the possibility to disable adding the menu (e.g. cfg.uimenu = 'no'). When creating custom figures (e.g. figure that interactively browses through TFRs of single events) that repeatedly calls ft_singleplotXXX the menu is added multiple times as well. It would be convenient if you can disable this through the cfg.
