        thetext: "sometimes, loadvar is complaining that a .mat-file cannot be read, but it succeeds immediately thereafter. \nI attached an excerpt from my command window to illustrate the problem. I just called the same function again and again, until it succeeds. Btw, it is not due to lack of memory, cause the mentat I am working on still has 6GB unused memory available."

          I cannot tell, I never encountered this problem before
          Maybe it's related to the short time in between loading of multiple files?

          can you reproduce it?

          can you reproduce it outside of fieldtrip (just with many loads)?

          if so, does it depend on where the data comes from (NFS, locally attached disk on a linux box, CIFS, locally attached disk on a windows box)?

          If it is NFS specific (which I guess is the only connection over which you tested sofar), then the TG should get involved in the diagnosis.
