          Created attachment 807
          script to reproduce the bug

          hi,
          the attached script does a lcmv source analysis using NEUROMAG data. both magentometers and gradiometers are used.

          the only difference between the two calculations is that one is done with a grid and leadfield in meters, the other in centimeters.

          when i do that with an old ft version, the output of the calculations (i.e., the lcmv power as well as the leadfields) differ but are a mere scaling of each other. i saw that there were previous reports of that topic. this is only confusing but something we could live with.

          BUT in the latest fieldtrip versions, the tra field is set for the gradiometers. when the sensors are converted to a different unit, only the tra entries for the gradiometers get scaled accordingly while the entries for the magnetometers are still 1. this leads to entirely different leadfields and thus entirely different results after source analysis.

          the attached script should run with any fif file. if you need an example fif file, please let me know and i will provide you with a link.

          best,
          thomas

          The metric units influence the outcome, because of the gradiometer units depending on distance.

          I guess that this has been discussed at Biomag (I recall a somewhat heated discussion at least). Can we close this, or does it need follow up?

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #1)
          yes, it is what we discussed at the biomag and i took the advice by robert and can confirm that he is right.

          this bug can thus be closed.
