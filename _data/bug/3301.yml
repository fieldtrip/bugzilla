          This is because the value of cfg.padding is the length of the snippet that is read from disk, including the padding.
          Perhaps it would be an idea to add a warning indeed.

          I see; "preprocessing parameter cfg.padding defines the duration to which the data in the trial will be padded"

          That was counter-intuitive indeed. The default 0 seconds suggests nothing is added to the trial and that setting it to 0.5 for instance would add half a second (on each side). Instead, the 0 value is just a switch variable for not padding. cfg.padding = 'no' as a default would be more intuitively clear.

          It's also not clear how to pad trials with different lengths.

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #1)

          added:

          ft_warning('no padding applied because the padding duration is shorter than the trial');
