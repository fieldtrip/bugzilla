        thetext: "Hi guys,\nsmall thing:\nit seems that I can't specify a sample range to process events of a gdf file. In ft_read_event.m on line 364 begsample and endsample are not passed to the read_trigger function \n\nthat created an out of memory error, as my gdf is rather large and the evoked biosig toolbox command tries to read it all at once. so I fixed it in my local copy by providing those parameters.\n\nthanks\nAndrei"

          Created attachment 186
          the modified ft_read_event.m file to handle sample range for gdf format

          I only modified line 364 to add the 'minsample' and 'maxsample'

          also note: it seems that most other functions like ft_read_data or read_trigger use 'begsample' and 'endsample' to specify a range, whereas in ft_read_event the parameters are called 'minsample' and 'maxsample', may be would nice to make it consistent to avoid confusion

          thanks

          That is indeed something to consider. The full specification of event selection (which is especially relevant for inline realtime systems) is defined in fileio/ft_filter_event.

          I have incorporated your fix, see SVN revision 5223 (note that I referred to the wrong bug in the commit msg!).

          @Andrei, could you verify that the changed code does indeed work as you intended?

          BTW, please note that *tonight* (2012-2-1) there will be no fieldtrip release related to the huge number of fixes that we made. So, please use the version of 2012-2-2 for verification.

          Following the bug-binge, the last few days we have not had any internal issues with our "beta testers". So I have re-enabled the automatic ftp release script.
