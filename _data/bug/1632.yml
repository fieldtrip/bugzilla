          A potentially useful webpage: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_keyboard_shortcuts

          For now, I have inventorized the following keyboard shortcuts that might be of use in FT plots. Wherever I have mentioned Ctrl, the Mac equivalent would be to use the Apple-icon key.

          Ctrl++  -  Zoom in
          Ctrl+-  -  Zoom out
          Ctrl+0  -  Reset zoom to default
          These are pretty much the default everywhere. However, in many cases zooming is twodimensional, while we want to have a one-dimensional zoom functionality. I propose to make the above keys implement a vertical zoom (so a data display scaling), while Shift+the above combinations implement horizontal zoom (so usually a time display scaling). I don't think there is a "common usage"/"best practice" concerning multiple one-dimensional zoom keyboard shortcuts.

          Arrow keys: nudge the data by small amounts.
          Shift + Arrow keys: nudge the data by larger amounts.
          Left/right should nudge through time; I imagine up/down keys to nudge through channels/components in the databrowser.

          Also to keep in mind: when creating user interfaces, Tab should be useable to navigate to the intuitively next interface element (and Shift+Tab to the previous one). Not sure whether this is implemented automatically in Matlab interfaces.

          That's actually it for now. A bit less than I was hoping for/expecting. Any other functionalities that might require keyboard shortcuts?

        thetext: "For bug #1644 Arjen had to get an example on how to deal with keyboard input in the realtime headlocalizer GUI. For that I found these functions that seem to do something with it:\n\nmanzana> grep -i KeyPressFcn *.m\nft_analysisprotocol.m:    set(fig, 'KeyPressFcn', @key);\nft_databrowser.m:set(h, 'KeyPressFcn',           @keyboard_cb);\nft_multiplotTFR.m:  set(gcf, 'KeyPressFcn', {@key_sub, zmin, zmax})\nft_singleplotER.m:  set(gcf, 'keypressfcn', {@key_sub, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax})\nft_singleplotTFR.m:  set(gcf, 'KeyPressFcn', {@key_sub, zmin, zmax})\nft_topoplotTFR.m:  set(gcf, 'KeyPressFcn', {@key_sub, zmin, zmax})\n\nExplaining them to Arjen, I realized that there are some functions that make a figure and then get stuck in a while loop (ft_realtime_headlocalizer, ft_sourceplot) and some functions that immediately return (a.o. multiplot). \n\nAs far as I know ft_databrowser is the only one in which the behavior regarding returning to the command line depends on the users specification of the function call. If the user specifies an output argument, it does not return (but rather waits until the user clicked all artifacts), if the user specifies no output argument it returns immediately. This \"return to command line\" behavior should be made consistent over functions (and hence included in the guidelines)."
