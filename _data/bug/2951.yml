        thetext: Will this be pushed forward anytime soon? I would assume that Eric's team will follow up on this. If that's not the case, I suggest to abandon this bug for the time being, and close it. The current version of the code is not functional at all. If it's not to change in the near future, I suggest to remove it from the repository.

We have recently entirely moved to github for version control, and git provides convenient functionality to develop new functionality in separate branches, avoiding half-finished projects in the ''release'' version of the code, which in turn ensures a much more stable software.'

          Can the relevant code (pertaining to lagged coherence) by organised in Github in such a way that I can modify it in such a way that it does not disturb the functionality of the release version as a whole. If so, I would like to know whether and how this is achieved. I could also drop down by your office and you could just show me where it is (and authorise me to make changes).

          best,
          Eric

          Hi Eric,
          It most certainly can! It's no problem to show you how to get started.


          There's already quite some useful information in the link below.

          Otherwise, just drop by.
