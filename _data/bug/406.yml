          This is caused by a bug in the code. This has been fixed, and available in tonight's download version.

          FIXME: why should the scaling only be relevant in the case of power (I suspect it should also be applied when crsspctrm or fourierspctrm is requested)...
          Why not perform the scaling of the tapers in the sine_taper function?

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
