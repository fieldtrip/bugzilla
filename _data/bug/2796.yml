          [bug2796-sourceavg 67dbb8c] restructuring - replace all code that uses source.avg with the new (flat) source structure. This is a challenging refactoring of the code, and the current commit status is intermediate and not very well defined. See http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=2796

        thetext: "JM already found some of the issues. I did further testing, which shows that the inside handling was actually still quite in a rough state. I updated all functions in fieldtrip/inverse to do the inside handling correctly.\n\nit would be good to write a test script that deals with the source.avg and source.trial representation, but also with the various inverse methods. E.g. I guess that nobody has ever tried whether the eloreta implementation works on single trial data. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nr10170 | roboos | 2015-02-05 13:59:15 +0100 (Thu, 05 Feb 2015) | 2 lines\n\nbugfix - removed three more ocurrences of dip.outside.

          there are a number of test scripts failing because inside the test script it is assumed that inside is represented as list of indices. Furthermore, some lower-level functions (in subdirectories) are still coded for a indexed representation.

          Potentially these ones

          I am currently working on making ft_sourcedescriptives work for me (concerning the deprecated .avg, .trial, .method etc. for PCC input) and I'd like to do it in a way that makes later merging it with the main branch one day most likely.

          Where is the average over trials, as calculated by ft_sourcedescriptives, supposed to be represented under the new convention?

          Is it supposed to replace the trials represented in cell arrays under source.pow? In that way a structure can never have both, trials and their average?
