          (In reply to comment #4)
          I checked, and no, this is not related. Fortunately, numerical accuracy does not come into play with this one.

          The issue is with this line 286:

            trlshift = round((begsamplatency(i)-latency(1))*data.fsample);

          It computes the number of zeros that have to be added at the beginning of a trial, if the trial's time axis starts after the total latency window for which the average will be computed. Ideally, the expression passed to round() should always yield an integer number, but, unfortunately, it does not. Thus, round() is used to make it integer. Sometimes, the expression yields values >= 0.5, thus leading to a rounding up. This means that the data used from this trial will be one sample longer than the data from other trials in which the shift was rounded down. Therefore, the sum cannot be computed anymore.

          My solution is to change line 286 to:

            trlshift = floor((begsamplatency(i)-latency(1))*data.fsample);

          so simply always force a round down. It seems to work, and I do think it is valid. Ideally, we would not have a conversion between samples and time points here, but that would require a major overhaul of ft_timelockanalysis.

          Fixed in revision 5997.
