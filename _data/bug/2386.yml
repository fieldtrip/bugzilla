        thetext: "electrodes are now plotted as points by ft_plot_sens. MATLAB makes these points very small on high-resolution screens (it seems 1 pixel on my screen).  The ft_plot_sens can plot gradiometers as coils. Similarly, it would be nice to plot electrodes as \"disks\". \n\nThat would involve the determination of the center of the head (approximate), make a small triangulated cylinder (should be very short compared to the diameter, but have some volume) and place that cylinder at the electrode position, with the axis along the direction from the center of the head.\n\nI am thinking of a ~5 mm diameter and ~2 mm length cylinder.\n\nSee plotting/private/cylinder.m and look at the ft_dipole_plot functionality (which plots a cylinder together with a cone)."

        thetext: Is still on the wish list? ft_plot_sens now can plot 3D spheres. The cylinders would indeed give a more realistic view of how the electrodes were placed in relationship to the scalp/cortex.
