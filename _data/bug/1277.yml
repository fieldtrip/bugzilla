        thetext: Would this functionality not fit more appropriately with ft_preprocessing (like cfg.derivative, also a prewhitening technique)?

        thetext: prewhitening code is experimental, and gateway to Kensuke's code was there for testing. I won't take responsibility for this functionality so I removed this part. Revision 5190
