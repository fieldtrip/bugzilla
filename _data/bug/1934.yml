        thetext: "I stumbled on this patch from a user, which I think went undetected for 9 months :-( \n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/issues/detail?id=1\n\nI did not know that users were able to contribute this way. Somewhere in autumn 2012 I changed the email settings on googlecode, so hopefully we'll stay better informed of such comments and contributions in the future.\n\nThe bug+patch pertains to something in an \"abandoned\" branch, so not really important, but a similar piece of code might also be in use somewhere in the trunk."

        thetext: The link in this bug does not work anymore, with the discontinuation of googlecode. I suggest to close it, unless Robert still has access to the 'patch'.
