        thetext: i.e. the videos on Youtube should have English subtitles. This makes it easier for everyone to follow the lectures.

        thetext: Youtube cannot be opened inside mainland China. It might be necessary to upload fieldtrip videos on Chinese video website, like youku.com. And maybe it is better to make Chinese version of the subtitles since it could be easier for most students to understand.

          Good to know about access limitations on Youtube.  How is access to github.com?

          Prior to making Chinese subtitles, we should have English ones (which are to be translated).

        thetext: github being slow should not be a problem for occasional synchronization of the documentation, it is just annoying when browsing the github website.

        thetext: I think in most time Githut is accessible in China. But I can upload a zip file of Fieldtrip to the server in China once a month. It is also easier for students to download.
