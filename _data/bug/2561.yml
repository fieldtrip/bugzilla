        thetext: I reverted back to old version of fieldtrip 04042013. ft_select_data seems to work fine, though it has ft_selectdata_old and ft_selectdata_new subfunctions. So, the problem is in the newer version.

          this is due to the same problem as reported elsewhere, hence I'll mark it as duplicate.
