          I noticed in ft_read_header the following


              if any(~cellfun(@isempty,strfind(coeftype, 'G1AR')))
                try
                  [alphaMEG,MEGlist,Refindex] = getCTFBalanceCoefs(orig, 'G3AR', 'T');
                  orig.BalanceCoefs.G3AR.alphaMEG  = alphaMEG;
                  orig.BalanceCoefs.G3AR.MEGlist   = MEGlist;
                  orig.BalanceCoefs.G3AR.Refindex  = Refindex;
                catch
                  % May not want a warning here if these are not commonly used.
                  % Already get a (fprintf) warning from getCTFBalanceCoefs.m
                  % warning('cannot read balancing coefficients for G3AR');
                end
              end

          which is part of  alonger section of coeftypes. It would make more sense to try and read all possible balancing coefficients ("for each coeftype try getCTFBalanceCoefs").

          Furthermore, a possible bug is that the code mixes up the G1AR and G3AR types.

          This should be tested with some datasets at hand

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

        thetext: "the sequence of try-catch statements for the different types should be avoided. Rather, it should just do what needs to be done. More something along the lines of \n\nfor i=1:length(coeftype)\nthistype = coeftype{i};\nread it with getCTFBalanceCoefs and store it\nend\n\nThe potential mix up is in the inconsistent use of G1AR in the if_any_cellfun(...) and G1AR in the code immediately below. The potential bug is not serious, but could result in either G1AR or G1AR not being present in the structure (i.e. \"G1AR is not detected, so G3AR is not read\").\n\nPS try-catch in general should be avoided as coding style to deal with known exceptions. It is lazy programming, can cause other problems to remain invisible, and moreover it is slow (setting up the exception handler takes time)."
