          This all seems to be related to bug 1311 and 1348.

          I suggest to revisit 1311 and make a thorough test script with sufficient data.

          it might also relate to bug #1490 which I took over from Roemer and for which promised to make a test script with multiple neuroscan datasets. The test script could also include this dataset.

          Anahita, would you mind sharing one of your problematic cnt files with us? Ideally it would be as small as possible for practical reasons.

          Hi,
          Here is a sample EEG recording file.
          http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15215625/sub1E3a.cnt
          Hope it helps.

        thetext: "I have made changes in the code to solve bug 1490. Following those changes I also made a very simple test script for this bug, see \nhttp://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=5914\nand\nhttp://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/browse/trunk/test/test_bug1359.m\n\nBased on that test script and visual inspection it seems that the data contains some meaningful channels. There are also a lot of channels that are all zero, but with some channels being non-zero and containing physiological signals and electrode drifts, it is difficult to imagine that the file was incorrectly read.\n\nCould you please confirm that the data is now read correctly, by downloading the latest fieldtrip version tomorrow (that is fieldtrip-20120606.zip on the ftp server, or revision 5913 or later from svn)? I suggest that you compare the data as read in fieldtrip (using the eeglab loadcnt reading function) with another implementation, or perhaps with the neuroscan software."

          Hi Anahita,

          I just checked what Robert's been saying, and can confirm that with the newest FieldTrip version the data has positive and negative values. However, most channels are just zeros, whereas the others look quite normal. Can you please tell us what the data should look like? e.g. give the range of the values that they should have? Without knowing what the data should look like, we cannot check whether the data is read in correctly :/ Best would be of course, if you check whether the data is read in correctly yourself and then report back. Thanks in advance for your cooperation!

          Best,
          Jörn

        thetext: "Hi,\nSorry for the delay but I am currently out of the country.\nI should have mentioned earlier that this data was a single electrode recording..so the only channels active would be Fz and the 4 eye electrodes. AFz and A1 are ground and reference electrodes respectively.\nIf you have got positive and negative values in these channels, then the code should be working correctly. The rest of the channels are supposed to have zeroes only. \nSorry for not mentioning this earlier!\nThanks for sorting this problem out.\nBest,\nAnahita."

        thetext: There are indeed 5 non-zero channels, so I assume that this got fixed with bug 1490. Thanks for reporting this and helping out! Should you observe any other problems with neursoscan data, feel free to just file another bug.
