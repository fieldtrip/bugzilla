        thetext: "Cyril gave a nice presentation about TFCE in Aspet (implemented in LIMO). TFCE is a generalization of the cluster-mass statistic (see Smith et al 2009) and it's an elegant way to form clusters without setting thresholds (like the clusteralpha value used in the nonparametric cluster-based permutation test). \n\nTFCE value at a given location and time point is obtained by the integral of the cluster extent and height (see Pernet et al 2015)\n\nReferences\n\nSmith, S.

          Hi Diego, This is a duplicate bug of 2287, which I at some point closed again, because nobody seemed interested at the time. I have some code available that does the tfce as per Steve and Thomas' original paper. May be relatively straightforward to implement. Otherwise, we may tap into LIMO's implementation.

          *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 2287 ***

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #1)
          Thanks Jan-Mathijs! I'll start from scratch and make sure that LIMO and Steve-Thomas' original paper are the same. Feel free to send me the code in case you've it but no worries if not ;)
