          Hello fieldtrip -

          We have a Elekta Neuromag 306 scanner, and I'm trying to select only the gradiometers. The magnetometers are labeled 'MEGxxx1', where x can be any number, and the gradiometers are either 'MEGxxx2' or 'MEGxxx3'. However, using ft_channelselection results in the following error:

          ~~~~
          >> ft_channelselection({'all','-STI*','-MEG*1'}, cfg.hdr.label)
          ??? Matrix index is out of range for deletion.

          Error in ==> ft_channelselection at 287
          channel([
          ~~~~

          This error is somewhat complex, as I was able to determine that ft_channelselection recursively calls itself a number of times while running, and I was unable to figure out what is causing this problem. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

        thetext: I was just browsing through some bugs, and saw that this has been an issue some while ago. I think I fixed this problem as well by fixing bug 670. Can someone check and verify?
