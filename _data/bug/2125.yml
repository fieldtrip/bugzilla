          It seems that a file is not closed after being read through read_biosemi_bdf.m.
          This was noticed by running fopen('all') after using fileio.

          Yes, it seems that fopen is called twice (once in the main function body, once in a subfunction), but fclose is only called once.

          I guess it makes sense to pass the file identifier to the subfunction to avoid fopening the file each time the subfunction is called.

          Alternatively, adding an fclose ad the end of the main function body would do the trick.

          Shall we vote?

          read_edf also has this issue.

          added fclose(EDF.FILE.FID) in read_edf and read_biosemi_bdf in revision 8119
