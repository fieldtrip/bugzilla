        thetext: "Dear Jan-Mathijs,\n\nI re-runned the script with a recent version of Fieldtrip (20110412).\nThe struct Data now looks like this:\n\n         label: {31x1 cell}\n          time: [1x350 double]\n    individual: [31x31x350 double]\n        dimord: 'subj_chan_time'\n           cfg: [1x1 struct]\n           \nHowever, I still get the same error:\n\n??? Attempted to access n(1); index out of bounds because numel(n)=0.\n\nError in ==> dimlength at 115\n        if ~all(n==n(1))\n\nError in ==> dimlength at 46\n      n{k}(i) = dimlength(data, dimtok{i}, fn{k});\n\nError in ==> seloverdim at 39\n[reduceddim, fntmp] = dimlength(data);\n\nError in ==> ft_selectdata at 563\n  if selectchan, data = seloverdim(data, 'chan', selchan, fb); end\n\nThere seems to be a problem in function dimlength.\n\nBest,\nMark\n\nI think that this is caused by the data having both 31 channels and subjects. try to reproduce this."
