          On line 220 in ft_volumelookup it gives the following error:

          Error using ft_volumelookup (line 220)
          there is a mismatch between the coordinate system in the atlas and the coordinate system in
          the data, which cannot be resolved

          The coordinate system in the atlas is 'mni' and the coordinate system in the data is 'spm'. There doesnt appear to be a way of handling these coordinate systems in the code.

          The only way to deal with it is to force the coordinate system to be the other's coordinate system because ft_convert_coordsys doesnt change mni to spm or vise versa.

        thetext: coordsys = 'spm' and coordsys = 'mni' are equivalent. Please change cfg.inputcoord into 'mmi'. Then it should work.

          Unforunately that doesnt work, you need to force it be mni by going atlas/mri.coordsys = 'mni'.

          I couldnt find where I could have cfg.inputcoord = 'mni' to fix the issue.

          Forcing the coordsys just makes me feel like I am doing something wrong haha
