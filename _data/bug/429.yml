        thetext: I tracked it down to apply_warp, and deeper to rigidbody. It turned out that that got a 4x4, whereas it expected a 1x6 input vector. I added additional checks to catch this misuse, and fixed the real problem at the level of ft_electroderealign.

          I closed all the bugs that I resolved earlier today. These have been discussed
          at the Fieldtrip meeting and should not show up any more at the next meeting.
          If you feel that one of these bugs should not have been closed, you have to
          reopen it.
