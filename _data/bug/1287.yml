        thetext: The difference seems to be in the channel locations. Take a look at the channel closest to an 'ear'. In the original image the channel stays in place after megplanar, in the new one it shifts.

        thetext: I cannot tell. In the beginning I assumed the former, now I have a strong preference for the later. But I am not sure how to use the same layout as on the tutorial page (it's not CTF151.lay) - so this bug here might be invalid ;)
