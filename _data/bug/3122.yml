        fieldtripp2fiff fails when trying to export data containing more than 10 values of a given type.

        The problem comes from the function convert event (l.280 in the fieldtrip2fiff.m file). This function assumes that a given event type cannot take more than 10 different values.

        A very simple fix would be to replace all occurrences of "10" in this function by size(ev_value). However this would change the mapping of events.

        Maybe one could replace it by max(10,size(ev_value)) so that we are still consistent with the old mapping, but the function still work for data with more event values...
