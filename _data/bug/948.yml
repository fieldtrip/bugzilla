          to start with, it points to a file that does not exist. I commented out the non functional code.
          The file on which the original code worked should be recovered, so that this part of the test script can also be used.

          I created the mat-file avgFIC when I wrote that script, must have forgotten to upload that (done)
          The only other thing that failed for me with my initial script is that the plotting did not work, because I had to specify a layout. The whole script worked before when I made it, and works now again. I restored it and commented it in again.

          Btw, the rationale behind the code is that it checks whether the local maxima/minima stay approximately the same. Initially, I wanted to check whether I did something wrong after changing the neighbourselection stuff, luckily, I didn't
