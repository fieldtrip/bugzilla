          So, if I interpret this correctly, we want CVS's $id$ keyword expansion behaviour, but in Subversion.

          It seems that this might be problematic, since it requires a modification of the *local* SVN configuration, which apparently cannot be imposed centrally [1].
          I'll investigate what is possible.

          Created attachment 185
          Script to automatically strip CVS logs

          I committed a fix. It was more difficult than I thought due to *multiline* regular expressions that are hard to do in sed. The files in external were not changed.
