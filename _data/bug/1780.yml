          ft_prepare_headmodel (line 203) is calling a function prepare_singleshell (when you run the test_tutorial_beamformer). The output on the screen is different that what I would expect given the input (e.g. there is no message about thresholding, only there is message about smoothing. But by default smoothing and also thresholding should be done by calling volumesmooth and volumethreshold). When I correct the call of prepare_singleshell to ft_prepare_singleshell, the output on the screen is the expected (I see a message also about thresholding).

          Regarding that prepare_singleshell is a compatibility wrapper that points to ft_prepare_singleshell, it gives me a headache to figure what's happening. Is it possible that the input for the function is passed over in a different way to ft_prepare_singlehell compared to as it would be called directly?

          Anyway, I think the best is to correct prepare_singleshell to ft_prepare_singleshell, and figure out the rest later.

          Inside the ft_prepare_headmodel there are a few methods that need a single triangulated brain surface, especially for MEG. These call the prepare_singleshell method that is implemented as subfunction in ft_prepare_headmodel, see line 481.

          It should indeed not be confused with compat/prepare_singleshell, which is the compat version for ft_prepare_singleshell. I believe that the present implementation is correct, and it should not be ft prefixed.

          compat/prepare_singleshell should never be used any more. It is also not used here.

          ft_prepare_singleshell should according to our own documentation also not be used any more (but instead people should switch over to ft_prepare_headmodel), although people are for now still allowed to use it in their scripts.

          Johanna (CC) is working on a new version of ft_prepare_headmodel that will hopefully clarify all these issues.
