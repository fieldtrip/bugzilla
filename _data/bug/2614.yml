          I have been getting the error:

          ??? Reference to non-existent field 'dimord'.
          Error in ==> ft_selectdata_old at 468
              rpttapflag = ~isempty(strfind(data.dimord, 'rpttap'));
          Error in ==> ft_selectdata at 78
            [varargout{1:nargout}] = ft_selectdata_old(varargin{:});
          Error in ==> ft_freqanalysis at 215
            data = ft_selectdata(data, 'rpt', cfg.trials);
          Error in ==> lena_do_fastICA_ed at 134
          TFData1_h = ft_freqanalysis(cfg,comp);

          when running a frequency analysis that worked previously.
          Colleagues have further found this:
           there is an inconvenience in the ft_freqanalysis function since it changed on the 12th of June 2014.
          This implies that if you run ft_componentanalysis before
          ft_freqanalysis on preprocessed data, there are both 'raw' and 'comp'
          features detected by ft_freqanalysis, leading to the function defining
          the input as 'raw+comp' and expecting a dimord field in the data
          structure, which is not supplied by default.

          Best,

          Lena

          Hi Lena,

          Thanks for reporting it here. This was also reported by email by Floris and has been fixed by now. See bug #2613.
