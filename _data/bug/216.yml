          FT_QUALITYCHECK should read data and visualize the quantification of its quality

          There will be 3 steps for a user to check his/her data.

          1) create an ouput.mat file with the quantified data (which ft_qualitycheck will do)

          2) visualize an overview of the results (which ft_qualitycheck will do)

          3) a more detailed inspection (user, and some examples on the WIKI)



          to do list of adjustments/implementations:
          - powspctrm: 0-400 hz, loglog plot
          - remove pie's and possibly add day of the week
          - min/maxima: change to mean and range, fixed y-axis
          - timelimits: max 1 hour, 2nd plot when exceeding
          - linenoise: take ratio, semilogy + grid plot
          - lowfreq noise: semilogy + grid plot
          - topo: colormap dutch, based on artifacts where max-min'ish > something, plot the sum in stead of the mean per 10 secs, interpmethod nearest
          - topoREF: imsagesc, matrix-like in stead of 'organised'
          - update document help with the user steps
          - triggers found per chan
          - timeaxis should be 5,10,15,etc. secs
          - also show which channels are missing from the analysis
          - .mat file should behave according to a timelock analysis structure

          - topo: colormap dutch, sum of artifacts instead of mean per trial,
          interpmethod nearest
          - headmotion: barplot -> boxplot (second from below in doc page, ylim[0 10] mm,
          change coilnames to N,L,R
          - topoplot colorbar should be white -> red ('hot')
          - topoREF: imsagesc, matrix-like in stead of 'organised': give sensornames with
          > 0 artifacts, remove scale etc.
          - show which channels are missing from the recording
          - BTI-compatibility
          - change linenoise ratio into linenoise absolute raw power. This speeds up the
          analysis process as freqanalysis can be called one time less.
          - change legend, titles etc (e.g. 'headmotion from start')
          - patching 10% of maxima and minima around the mean, for example with this line
          of code:
          h = patch([time time(end:-1:1) time(1)], [avg_min avg_max(end:-1:1)
          avg_min(1)], 'HandleVisibility', 'Off');
          uistack(h, 'bottom');
          where avg_min = avg - minima /10
          and avg_max = avg + maxima /10
          - chronjob ft_qualitycheck at Odin
          - chronjob should match with ft_qualitycheck 'exportname'
          - output .mat file has info, timelock, freq, summary and headpos structure
          - timecourses of headcoil distances
          - cleaned up code
          - updated help
          - timelimits: max 1 hour, 2nd plot when exceeding
          - triggers/events found
          - remove quantification sliders
