        thetext: I just noticed the first version of ft_networkanalysis appear in my svn copy. My suggestion is (might also be your plan) to move all code from ft_connectivity_bct into ft_networkanalysis and keep fieldtrip/connectivity focussed to computing the "edges", and not have the module extend towards graph-like network analysis.
