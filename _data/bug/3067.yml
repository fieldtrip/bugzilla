        thetext: "Created attachment 774\ntest script to load variables and replicate result\n\nDear Fieldtrip Developers,\n\nI have recently been using the 'sam' beamformer in fieldtrip (20160116), and I am a bit puzzled by the results. I wonder if you could please help me figure out if I'm doing something wrong, or if there's a problem with the current implementation of SAM.\n\nFirstly, I should say that sam used to throw an error when using precomputed leadfields. My colleague Philipp Ruhnau helped looked into this for me, and he quickly identified the problem in line 90 of beamformer_sam. So this first bug would seem to be fixable by changing line 90, \n...from:\ndip.leadfield = dip.leadfield(dip.inside);\n...to:\ndip.leadfield = dip.leadfield(originside);\n\nSecondly, this made me wonder if the same indexing problem wouldn't apply to the precomputed filters, line 94, i.e. dip.filter = dip.filter(originside). However, I am unable to identify the part of the code that makes use of the precomputed filters. I may well miss something here, but it would appear to me that the dip.filter variable is unused, and that the weights are always re-calculated for the optimal source orientation (lines 230-232).\n\nI wonder if this could explain the odd results I got when running sam on a number of subjects from a visual gamma paradigm. I would almost always observe the expected blob in the occipital lobe, but only after re-scaling, as the source power values would often be dominated by a few voxels in random locations, most frequently at the centre of the head (see this figure for an example: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lt6eq1eqoubtfbb/src_percentagechange.png?dl=0). \n\nI attach a short piece of code to replicate the problem, and a link to the test data (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/50acdksbm5iuno7/AADH2-0f0q6YSM2Fhp6Gxmhma?dl=0).\n\nApologies if this is simply due to a mistake on my side.\n\nBest wishes,\nLorenzo Magazzini"

          Dear developers,

          Is there any chance that you could spare some time to look into this? Please let me know if I should provide more information/scripts/data to facilitate the process.

          Many thanks,

          Lorenzo

        thetext: "guys, sorry for our unresponsiveness of late, but we are extremely short-handed.\nif you want to push this forward at short notice, I suggest that you make the code changes yourself in a local branch of your own git-fork. See: \n\nhttp://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/git\n\nAfter sufficient testing on your end, you can submit a pull request, we will evaluate the suggested changes to the code, and approve it if applicable."
