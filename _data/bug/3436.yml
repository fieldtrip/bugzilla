        thetext: "Created attachment 866\nplot figure with the legend bug\n\nHi,\nI put the bug report in test component because I had to select something but it's actually a bug induce by the FieldTrip to the basic legend function of Matlab.\nWhen I add FieldTrip to my path and execute the following simple code \n\ny = sin(0.01:0.01:10);\nx = sin(0.01:0.01:10).^2;\nplot(x) \nhold on; plot(y)\nlegend('toto', 'boum')\n\nI got the following result (see attachment). The plot is normal without FieldTrip in my path and I cannot see any legend or plot function in FieldTrip, so I have no idea what's happening.\n\nThanks for your help."

What makes you think it is due to fieldtrip?\n\nDid you follow instructions at http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/should_i_add_fieldtrip_with_all_subdirectories_to_my_matlab_path\n\nI suspect that if you type \"which legend\" or if you type \"path\", it will disclose that you set up your path incorrectly."

        thetext: "Hi, \n\nYou're right, I didn't see the fieldtrip path instructions. When I add only fieldtrip to my path there is no bug. The legend bug is only happening when I add fieldtrip with all subdirectories (could be due to external stuff ?).\n\nAnyway thanks for you're help !\nRenaud"
