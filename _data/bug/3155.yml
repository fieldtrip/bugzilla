          I think I have been able to identify the cause of this problem:
          If we take a look at line 204 of the ft_channelselection function, we can see
          that the "switch senstype" does not take into account neuromag306_combined as possible value for senstype, it only takes into account "case {'neuromag306' 'neuromag306alt'}" (line 279).

          could you check the comments and changes in #3154 (from yesterday), I believe that already solves it. If not, please let me know.

          thanks
          Robert

          Thank you very much Robert, the changes in #3154 solved the issue.
          Please excuse me for duplicating the bug, I didn't realize #3154.

          Best regards,
          Jair
