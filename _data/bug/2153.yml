          Dear all,

          there might be a bug in the code read_brainvision_eeg.m

          Line 64 now reads:
            fseek(fid, hdr.NumberOfChannels*2*(begsample-1), 'cof');

          And I think it should be (as for Line 79):
            fseek(fid, hdr.NumberOfChannels*samplesize*(begsample-1), 'cof');

          I did not check the rest of the code, though, because it seemed to work....

          Thanks a lot

          bye

          Andrea

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #2)\n\nHello Jan-Mathijs,\n\neven though the cfg.tfl is correct, the trial data I get take only half of the trial length at the time. So, imagine I have 3 trials of length 1000 points. The indeces of the data I get are:\n\n1 1000\n500 1500\n1000 2000\n\nThe number of trials is correct but the data is epoched incorrectly. If I change Line 64 as:\n\n  fseek(fid, hdr.NumberOfChannels*samplesize*(begsample-1), 'cof'); \n\nit works. The variable samplesize was set to 2.\n\nIf you look at Line 79 you'll see the same kind of script.\n\nI cant send you some figures this afternoon though.\n\nbye\n\nAndrea"

        thetext: "I can see what the problem might be, if there are no channels selected the offset in the binary file is set by: fseek(fid, hdr.NumberOfChannels*2*(begsample-1), 'cof'); whereas if specific channels are selected the offset is set by  fseek(fid, hdr.NumberOfChannels*samplesize*(begsample-1) + (chanindx(chan)-1)*samplesize, 'bof');\n\nThe main difference being that samplesize is fixed to '2' in case no channels are selected. The samplesize, however, depends on hdr.BinaryFormat. Only in the case that hdr.BinaryFormat is 'int_16' the samplesize is 2. In case of 'int_32' and 'ieee_float_32' the samplesize is 4. In those cases the offset set by fseek will be half of that what it should be when no specific channels are selected. \n\nAs I am a brainvision user myself and never had these issues I looked into it. I didn't have issues because my datasets are stored in 'int_16' (samplesize=2).\n\nThis might also be related to bug2068. It could be that in that case the wrong data is read-in as well."

          I've made the change and committed it. I'll also try to find out if bug2068 is related.
