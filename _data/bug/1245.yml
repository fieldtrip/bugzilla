        thetext: "Hi,\n\nI was looking into a problem with plotting in SPM's interactive plotting tool which is a wrapper around FT code and it comes down to the fact that in ft_prepare _layout the cfg.channel field is not always used. In that particular case the layout is generated from cfg.elec field which has some extra sensors that should not be plotted, but the layout is generated at line 261 from all sensors without any further selection based on cfg.channel. Then in ft_multiplotER the selection of channels to plot is based on the layout and not on cfg.channel. \n\nSo what happens eventually is that some auxiliary channels with very high values are included in the plot and the plot is wrongly scaled as a result so nothing works. Please fix.\n\nThanks,\n\nVladimir"

          this apparently leads to scaling issues in plotting functions that do an automatic scaling based on all data values.

          @Vladimi: could you upload some problematic data please, including a small script/cfg to reproduce the problem?

          reproduced and fixed in revision 5105.

          The issue was related to the fact that the algorithm that determines the scale does not take only the to-be-plotted channels.

          Hi JM,

          This fix is not sufficient because:

          1) Although the extra channels are not taken into account for scaling they are still plotted which is not what the user wants.
          2) The scaling of the topoplot that one gets from the interactive feature is still wrong and does use the bad channels.
