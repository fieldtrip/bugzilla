          Hi Flor,

          We have this "new" ft_selectdata already for quite some time (like a year or so), so I suspect that you made a switch from a quite old version to the latest one.

          I was not aware that the old version could select components. How did you do that, i.e. what did you exactly specify on the command line?

          Robert

          Well, this issue is related to the fact that ft_selectdata does not operate on 'raw'ish types of data structures anymore.

          In other words, it will fail for channel and trial selection for datatypes 'raw' and 'comp'.

          Have you tried ft_preprocessing?

          cfg = [];
          cfg.channel = 23;
          compout = ft_preprocessing(cfg, compin);
