          Hi there buggers,

          Found my password... Anyway, here goes again:

          ft_volumerealign now expects the headshape struct in cfg.individual.headshape (or breaks on line 68).
          However, in my case its also calls ft_interactiverealign which expects cfg.headshape.headshape (line 509) which isn't passed through properly. At that point it is in cfg.headshape again.

          Its a bugger, no?

          All the best from the Swedish "summer". Hope its better wherever you are.

          Cheers,
          Stephen

          p.s. working on SVN rev 10561

        thetext: Aha, that explains it. Looks like Robert's recent changes to accommodate the new naming convention (from 'vol' to 'headmodel') causes some problems. Do you happen to have some data and code to quickly reproduce this?

          It crashes at the second call to ft_volumerealign. I attached the headshape. The MRI is too large to upload. Shall I send it to you (JM) by mail? Else you should be able to use any MRI, but then need to run through the first part.

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method          = 'interactive';
          cfg.coordsys        = 'neuromag';
          [mri_realigned]    = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri_orig);

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method = 'headshape';
          cfg.headshape.headshape = shape;
          [mri_realigned] = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri_realigned);
