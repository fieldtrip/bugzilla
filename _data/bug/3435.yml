          Line 73 of prepare_mesh_tetrahedral.m

          It seems that the code tries to feed an isovalue (which is defined in Line 72) to vol2mesh. If my understanding is correct, the use of vol2mesh
          [node, elem, face] = vol2mesh(seg, 1:mri.dim(1), 1:mri.dim(2), 1:mri.dim(3), 2, 2, isovalue);
          is incorrect, according to the documentation fo vol2mesh.

          I'd suggest changing the line to:
          [node, elem, face] = vol2mesh(seg, 1:mri.dim(1), 1:mri.dim(2), 1:mri.dim(3), 2, 2,1,'cgalsurf', isovalue);

        thetext: "So investigated prepare_mesh_tetrahedral line 72. Indeed i found an incorrect usage of vol2mesh. \n\nIt is used as followed:\nisovalue = 0.5;\n[node, elem, face] = vol2mesh(seg, 1:mri.dim(1), 1:mri.dim(2), 1:mri.dim(3), 2, 2, isovalue);\n\nHowever, looking into vol2mesh i found this usage:\nvol2mesh(img,ix,iy,iz,opt,maxvol,dofix,method,isovalues)\n\nAccording to the code we parsed the value 0.5 into dofix, and method and isovalues is left empty. However, dofix is a binary.\n\nSo I looked into vol2mesh. In line 60 an IF starts. Here is were the incorrect usage of vol2mesh is dealt with, with nargin=7 we end in line 65.\n\n\nSo I propose to change line 72, to make the behaviour more explicit, and consistent with the documentation. This will not change the output of prepare_mesh_tetrahedral.\n\nPull request is coming!"
