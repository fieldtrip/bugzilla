          Hmmm, this looks like a typo to me. I suspect that this indeed is wrong.

          The documentation and hopefully some test code may be on my Desktop PC. I cannot locate it on my Mac. I recall that I did most of the implementation in Windows, because I needed Windows-only software to compare the output.

          I have added Tineke and caspar to the CC list of this bug.

          @Tineke, could you share one of the windaq files with us for testing purposes? E.g. the one that you had on screen last Friday? See http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_should_i_send_example_data_to_the_developers

          We suspect (as you can read on bugzilla) that there is potentially a 2nd issue with the  present importer, i.e. one that I did not notice on Friday.

          Tineke just sent me a file. Here are the details according to her:

          Opbouw van de file:
          8 kanalen: sample frequency 12500 per kanaal (was de max instelling en de frequencyinhoud van de audiostimuli was 6.5 kHz)
          -1 kanaal als controle (dood dier aangekoppeld)
          -4 kanalen local fieldpotentials: brainstem, thalamus, cerebellum, cortex.
          -1 kanaal met stimulus markers (11 Hz)
          -1 kanaal met de frequentieinhoud van de stimuli (6.5 kHz piepjes, 20 ms, met envelop)
          -1 kanaal met wat de microfoon registreerde.

          Ik stuur ook de header die ik maakte om het in BrainVision in te openen.

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #5)

          I copied it to the directory /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/bug2569. Trying to read it, the bit "mask" in line 35 in read_wdq_header is giving me problems. I can work around it for the moment...

        thetext: "mac011> svn commit private/read_wdq_*m\nSending        private/read_wdq_data.m\nSending        private/read_wdq_header.m\nTransmitting file data ..\nCommitted revision 9514.\n\nthis change deals with the matlab change in bitget, includes some cleanups to the code to make the flow more clear, and has a change in header bitmasking for nchan. For the specific test dataset I now have, the mask with \"32\" (see code) would not do it. \n\nThe flow in the data regarding the chunks was actually not causing any problems, it was only difficult to see how the logic was.\n\nOh, one relevant change is on line 76 in read_wdq_data, where I changed\n  offset   = begsample(k) * hdr.nchan * 2;\ninto\n  offset   = (begsample(k)-1) * hdr.nchan * 2;\n\nThis is added to hdr.nbyteshdr and I guess it should be 0 if you want to read the first sample of the first channel. The 1-sample offset change applies both to data and triggers, so with a completely fresh analysis nobody would notice. It can only be observed if you take an old event structure from disk (or trl) and preprocess the data again. But since it is only a 1-sample shift, I don't think it is a problem.\n\n@Jan-mathijs: Could you check? To me it now all seems fine."
