          sorry Burkhard: as super user I was still logged in under your account when I added this comment. I will remove you from the CC list as you are not involved here.

          I have added you with username "esthhol". Please follow the documentation on http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/svn and get yourself a local working copy of the development version. If you have questions, please ask on the fieldtrip-bugs email list (which is the core team, i.e. the ~10 people at the meetings)

           1004   sudo useradd -c "Esther Holleman (DCN)" esthol
           1005  sudo passwd esthol

That means that you will get an nag-email every day, until you accept the responsibility for the bug and change the status to ASSIGNED. The fieldtrip-bugs email list also gets a nag-email every day for the list of NEW bugs, which you should have noticed (as you are now also on that list). \n\npresently remaining items:\n\n1) learn wiki syntax, please try the http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/playground/playground\n2) meet up with Lilla\n3) make structure for documentation/tutorial\n\nfor 1 you are on your own. I suggest we schedule 2 for next Wednesday, when I expect Lilla to attend the meeting. For 3 you can already start thinking and searching for a suitable dataset."

          This is probably never going to happen anymore. I suggest to close this one and to remove the development page.

          My secret hope of course is that my poking around revives the interest of the person initially assigned...
          If that's the case, you're more than welcome to 'unresolve' the status of this bug and crack on.
