          Detailled list of flaws:

           - For ctf64 data, sens.tra seems to be transposed (or is that only in the test data?), the method fails because it wants to multiply a 94x3 matrix with a 1x158 vector (if sens.tra is transposed, this becomes a 94x1 vector, which again transposed has the correct structure)
           - For neuromag306 and 122, 'ori' is not defined. Therefore, the method errors wenn two or three output arguments are desired. I assume 'ori' can be defined similarly as for other datatypes as: ori = sens.ori(ind, :)

        thetext: The problem for ctf64 is caused by a bug in ctf2grad, which handled the reference sensors incorrectly when the header data is obtained using the old reading routines. The ctf64 can only be read with the old reading routines, which revealed this bug.
