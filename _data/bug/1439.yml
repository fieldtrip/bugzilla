          When using  ft_denoise_synthetic to calculate e.g. 3rd order grads one has to use preprocessed data. Normally one only reads in those channels which are relevant for later analysis so output of preprocessing will be data without reference channels. If now subsequently using  ft_denoise_synthetic the output will be not not changed because reference channels are missing. However the new file will be marked as data.grad.balance.current: 'G3BR'
          This would be wrong. It could be helpful to include a warning if reference channels are missing and update the description accordingly.
          Best,
          Barbara

          included an explicit check for the presence of reference channel data and wrote test function
