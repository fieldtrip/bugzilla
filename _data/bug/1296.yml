          I could not read in my .mgz file when I was running ft_read_mri under a Windows machine.

          To test it, you can find an mgz file in /home/language/lilmag/grandaverage_mne.

          I know,  sigh.

          Should we make the default format that is used in the tutorials nifti? Or should we try to fix this?

        thetext: I think reading zipped mgh files is impossible on a PC (at least it is not supported by the code). Should we recommend the default format to be nifti, and thus change it all over the tutorial page, or should we make an explicit warning that the .mgz is only for linux and Mac? I personally prefer to use .mgz because it creates small files.

          I think we just should make a warning. And could we give an advice (alternative route, function..etc.) that people who have Windows could get a nifti output?

          I have adjusted the warning in the tutorial a bit. If that's fine with you, I think we can close this b.
