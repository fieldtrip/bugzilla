Ft_component_analysis.m mentions a prewhitening_filter2, but I can't find much more."

        thetext: "I don't see a prewhitening_filter2 in ft_componentanalysis... \n\nAt this moment the prewhitening is done inside the already existing low-level csp function. I believe this to be appropriate: the intended use of ft_componentanalysis is not to do the spatial unmixing in multiple steps, but rather in one, and the interest is only in the final step."

          The prewhitening_filter2 function appears to be missing from the repository. I reported the missing function as bug 1277.

          given that

          % additional options, see CSP for details
          cfg.csp = ft_getopt(cfg, 'csp', [])
          cfg.csp.numfilters = ft_getopt(cfg.csp, 'numfilters', 6)

          I suggest that the cfg.classlabel is moved to cfg.csp.classlabel which is also more consistent with other method-nested options.
