          this is relevant in light of the stockholm workshop.

          at the moment a lot of code excludes the presence of both an elec and grad field (so it does not only pertain to ft_read_sens), because it's often like this:

          if isfield(data, 'elec')
          elseif isfield(data, 'grad')
          end

          However, sometimes having both an elec and grad field makes sense. (e.g in neuromag data).

          First thing to do would be to inventorize where these instances occur.

          One obvious place would e.g. be ft_appenddata, where it should be possible to append meg with eeg data.
