        thetext: "In some cases it would be useful to have ft_rejectvisual also return the trlsel variable. \n\nAt the moment, if you want to apply trial rejection on other simultaneously recorded data, e.g. eye data or time-continuous MUA with different sampling rates, this is rather difficult. Basically, it's possible to use the sampleinfo of the artifact struct, but that becomes not necessarily unique anymore if the data contains data from different recording sessions.\n\nIf the trlsel is stored in the returned data.cfg or as a separate output argument this task becomes very simple."

        thetext: This can be already done if you code the ordinal trial number in the .trialinfo field. Basically, you can store there whatever you want. Not only the ordinal trial number can be specified, you can also add a column that pertains to the recording session. Ft_rejectvisual also prunes the trialinfo-matrix, so in this way you can get yourself all information you need.
