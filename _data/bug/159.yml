          Problem:
          The peerlist is not updated/erased if the peer-threads are already running (or something along that line)

          Test:
          >>clear all
          >>peermaster, peer('peerlist')
          >>peermaster, peer('peerlist')

          This wil give a number of peers the first time, but the second time it gives only one peer

          Since peer now moved to a private folder, this bug can best be reproduced by:

          >>clear all
          >>peermaster, peerlist
          >>peermaster, peerlist

          The first peerlist produces a list with all peers (as expected), the second peerlist contains a list with only one entry, i.e. the master.

          the problem was that the allowuser/host/group option would cause the peerlist to be erased (and then slowly built up again once the new discoveries come in and are checked against the access restrictions).

          I have solved it similar to starting the threads: only update the allowxxx if needed, and if so, do a 1.5 sec pause
