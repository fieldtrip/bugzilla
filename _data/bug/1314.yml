        thetext: Not sure exactly the plan or what's needed/required/assumed, but maybe nut_makeMNIvoi can help with ideas?  It takes a requested voxel spacing, assuming the subject's MRI has been normalised to MNI, and creates the grid in MNI coords, inside the bounds defined by the MNI brain and *_sn.mat mapping.

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #1)\n\nsomething along these lines was indeed what I was thinking of, and something like http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/create_single-subject_grids_in_individual_head_space_that_are_all_aligned_in_mni_space\n\nThe thought was inspired by a discussion with Vladimir, in which we looked at the SPM source reconstruction pipeline. SPM makes a lot of use of templates and warps them back and forth. We actually do the same, but not in a user-friendly way. \n\nMy idea is that instead of a long recipe as in the example script on the wiki, we would enhance the ft_prepare_sourcemodel function to allow for a  short recipe that involves\n- ft_normalisevolume\n- ft_prepare_sourcemodel"

          Created attachment 226
          Nutmeg file to create MNI voi

          I've attached the file in case it helps ideas. It needs some sub-functions, let me know if I should post those too.

          first implementation in revision 5270

          use as

          cfg = [];
          cfg.mri = ...
          cfg.grid.warpmni = 'yes';
          cfg.grid.resolution = 10;

          grid=ft_sourcemodel(cfg);



          TO DO: update documentation, and check the template grids
