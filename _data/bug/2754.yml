          Hi,

          It seems selectdata does not actually average over time when cfg.avgovertime = 'yes' or ...'avgovertime','yes'... (old). 'Latency' and 'toilim', respectively do work.

          Can anyone replicate this?

          Cheers,
          Stephen

The error is in cellmatmean around line 1221, where it takes the average over dim-1. \n\nThis appears to be due to the dimord of the trial field being incorrect, which is interpreted as 'chan_time', but should be '{rpt}_chan_time}'."

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #6)

          sorry, it goes wrong on the data.time cell-array, not on the data.trial cell-array.

          the dimord of data.time should be {rpt}_1_time?
