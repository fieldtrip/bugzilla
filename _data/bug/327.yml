        thetext: if there is no license limitation, and if the jobs are large in size (thereby causing th enetwork to be the bottleneck), the jobs get sent over to fresh peerslaves. It would be better if they were sent to the same peerslaves over and over again.

        thetext: "instead of  host.cpuinfo, it could be host.priority. \n\nThe default priority could be increased for mentat005,  and could automatically be incremented if there is another busy peerslave on the same machine (efficient license reuse)."

        thetext: "I am closing this bug because the development on the fieldtrip/peer toolbox will be put onto hold in favor of the fieldtrip/qsub toolbox. The qsub toolbox is more promising for the DCCN as a whole and hence requires attention. \n\nThe peer toolbox will remain available within fieldtrip, and external contributions to the  code will be considered for inclusion.\n\nIn the future, the development on fieldtrip/peer may be started up again and the bugs that I hereby close as \"wontfix\" can be revisited."
