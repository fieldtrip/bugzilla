          when plotting components with either ft_topoplotIC or ft_databrowser (cfg.viewmode = 'component') the colors change. with topoplot they are normal, i.e. range from red to blue but with the databrowser they all come out somewhat lightblue.

          cheers

          Hi Phyllis,

          this could be related to local or global color-scaling. This is a feature available in the databrowser. Have you tried playing around with this?

          From 'help ft_databrowser':

          cfg.compscale               = string, 'global' or 'local', defines whether the colormap for the topographic scaling is
                                             applied per topography or on all visualized components (default 'global')
