          Looks like it's related to git

          >> system(sprintf('git --version'))
          xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun

          ans =

               1

          Which, ironically, is an issue I've recently helped fixing (https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/issues/545).

          In short, reinstalling xcode solves the issue (in the OS terminal):

          xcode-select --install
