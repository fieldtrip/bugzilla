        thetext: "There exists a script in the test directory which is presently not being executed because it does not have the correct filename. \n\nLooking at \nhttp://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/list?path=/trunk/test/sourceanalysisDICS.m&start=7123\nit seems that it is work-in-progress by Jorn. I don't know why it was never finalized, but probably it is only a small change to copy the content of the test script over into the main test function for sourceanalysis."

          oh, I shouldn't have committed that file. Since we all worked in parallel on that function), I used that one as the dummy-file with the contents being put into test_ft_sourceanalysis.

          svn del sourceanalysisDICS.m
          svn ci sourceanalysisDICS.m -m "#2340 deleted deprecated file"
          Deleting       sourceanalysisDICS.m

          Committed revision 8798.
