          complete/extend/finish the documentation of the grad structure (including grad.tra)
          (begun here at:   http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/tra)

          I can try doing this with help from JM?

I think it would be nice to include it as a new FAQ alongside http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_are_electrodes_magnetometers_or_gradiometers_described\n\nOr perhaps all this should simply be incorporated into the above FAQ?\n\nThe last point in particular (how .tra looks for different acquisiton systems) needs work.   \n\nJM: I assign to you, as it goes along with bug 1481.  But of course feel free to reassign."

          I think this is now well enough covered in the FAQ. Some loose ends are still in the development page. I don't feel much inclined to spend much time to further improve the documentation, so I suggest to leave it at this. Feel free to take over again, if you really would like to address the remaining issues.
          Should we remove the development page?
