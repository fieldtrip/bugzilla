        So, assume that the first step in a pipeline is reading in the entire dataset, and the subsequent steps operate directly on the in-memory data.

        This is related to the handling of the cfg structures. By general principle, all FT functions have their own cfg structure. The exception is when you want to do the first steps of your analysis pipeline (selection of data segments, rejection of artifacts, etc.) without reading the data fully into memory. In that case, the cfg is kept between different function calls. A FAQ should be created on this, and it should be referenced from the tutorial.
