          Testing the test_beamformer.m script returns an error during the call to ft_sourceanalysis. This is because in ft_checkdata on line 1197 the label field is explicitly removed: data = rmfield(data, 'label');

          The test_script runs successfully after commenting the line out.
          Can somebody comment on whether this line is needed?

        thetext: 'removing the label field does make sense regarding the content: after this step there should only be crsspctrm and no powspctrm, whereas label refers to powspctrm. But it is uncommon (inpossible?) to obtain such a data structure by calling ft_freqanalysis, so FT functions in general would not expect label to be missing.'

          I looked at the code, it was due to a bug I introduced as an additional check on data consistency.
