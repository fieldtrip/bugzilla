        thetext: good point. cfg.dim should in this case be the grid.dim when the source space is defined on a 3D regular grid. Are you using cfg.implementation = 'new' or 'old' for ft_sourcestatistics?

          whatever the default is ;)
          btw, I figured that with cfg.dim out (it is kinda obvious), but it should be documented somewhere

        thetext: 'I agree. In the past it was added by statistics_wrapper, which was doing the data bookkeeping. It would make sense to add this behavior again to ft_sourcestatistics (implementation: ''old'' (=default)). No need for the user to specify this. It is only needed in statistics_montecarlo to know how to reshape the data for the 3D-clustering'

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

          generate test data that contain the different representations of source data:

          old vs new

          single subject vs multi subject

          pcc, dics, lcmv

          containing .avg  .trial

          volumetric vs surface based
