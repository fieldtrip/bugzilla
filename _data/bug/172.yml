        thetext: The function select_channel_list is in trunk/private. For trialfun_general to work it should be placed, as an external, in trunk/trialfun/private (which doesn't exist yet). I don't know how to do this, but this is how it can be fixed.

          externals are created like this

          cd ~/matlab/fieldtrip/trialfun

          mkdir private
          svn propedit svn:externals private

          this opens a text editor and you have to include the line

          ../../private/select_channel_list.m select_channel_list.m


          kind kan de was doen, ahum.

          Could you check whether it works?

          Thanks,

          JM

          I test it at home/common via a colleague, and it works perfect now. However, I get the following error in my own working copy during an svn update:
          ********
          svn: warning: Error handling externals definition for 'trialfun/private/select_channel_list.m':
          svn: warning: URL 'svn+ssh://roevdmei@cvs.fcdonders.nl/home/svnroot/fieldtrip/trunk/trialfun/private/select_channel_list.m' at revision 2073 doesn't exist
          ********

          Any idea what could be the problem?
