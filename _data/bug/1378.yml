        thetext: "Dear Yuval,\n\nthanks for the report. Supporting the mex files for all versions of the OSes and versions of MATLAB remains a challenge and shoudl if possible be improved. Linux 32 bit is one of the platforms that we don't use ourselves, so it gets more difficult to support. \n\nWhat is the linux version you use?\n\nI will try to setup a similar virtualbox (as I don't have a physical linux 32 bit machine any more) and see whether I can reproduce it. \n\nRobert"

          and which version of MATLAB?

          I don't think we can solve general library problems on operating systems, but we should be able to provide a "known to work" list with OS and MATLAB versions.

          I was going through some old bugs, and found this one. I tested it again, with  Ubuntu Natty 32bit as a VM on Mac OS X 10.6.8 and MATLAB 2010a.

          fieldtrip/test/test_ft_getopt now runs without problems, and which ft_getopt indicates the correct 32 bit mex file being used

          I guess that the problem has been resolved by now, although I don't know exactly when. Please reopen if you still encounter the problem.
