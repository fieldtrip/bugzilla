        thetext: "In the neuromag306 system, if you want to extract only gradiometer channels using ft_preprocessing, you need something like \n\n...\ncfg.channel   = {'MEGGRAD'};        \n...\ndata = ft_preprocessing(cfg);\n\ntherefore gradiometer sensors are identified by 'MEGGRAD', but in data.hdr.chantype the gradiometer channels are identified by 'megplanar'.\n\nIt would be better to be consistent here and use 'MEGGRAD' or 'megplanar' throughout the toolbox. This may take sometimes of the user to understand this and select the gradiometer channel."
