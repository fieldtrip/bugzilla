          as of yet, these functions in the plotting module contain code copied from ft_sourceplot. They should be converted into the appropriate intermediate functions:

          ft_plot_slice: take a volume, a transformation matrix, a point, and a vector, and plot the slice
          ft_plot_ortho: take 3 slices from ft_plot_slice, and plot them either in 3 subplots, or as an intersecting cross (like the old sliceinterp)

          ft_plot_montage: take a bunch of slices, and plot the montage

          these three functions are now in place, with limited functionality however.
          they need to be built into ft_sourceplot
