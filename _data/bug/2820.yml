          I am using the 'surface' option in ft_sourceplot, which calls ft_sourceinterpolate.  The error I get is: "Undefined function or variable 'dim'." on line 326.  I do not see dim being declared anywhere in the preceding code.  Does anyone know how this variable is supposed to come into existence?

          Cheers,
          Daniel

          Hi Daniel,

          I am not sure what approach you took in reconstructing the source-level activity, but most likely you need to set the .dim yourself. See e.g.
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/beamformingextended#plotting_sources_of_oscillatory_gamma-band_activity

        thetext: That might help if the dim field in my source data structure was copied into the local dim variable.  But like I said, the local dim variable is never initialized anywhere preceding the function call on line 326, where it is needed.

        thetext: could you share/paste the code (i.e. cfg settings) that you used to compute the source structure, and the code related to the call to ft_sourceplot?

        thetext: "Hi Daniel,\n\nI recall having made some changes to the handling of dimord and probably also of dim (i.e. the dimensions of the data). The line that seems affected is now line 324\n\ntmpnew = interp_gridded(functional.transform, tmp, anatomical.pos, 'projmethod', 'project', 'projvec', cfg.projvec, 'projweight', cfg.projweight, 'projcomb', cfg.projcomb, 'projthresh', cfg.projthresh, 'dim', dim);\n\nand I fail to see where that dim variable is being assigned. I guess it should be functional.dim or anatomical.dim. \n\nLet me try to reproduce the problem by interpolating some data with a specific cfg that should also end up at those lines..."
