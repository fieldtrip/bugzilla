          There should be a new (FieldTrip compatible) function for reducing the number of points in a cortical mesh (source)  (resulting in similar triangle sizes).

          This is for the development of minimum-norm estimate in FieldTrip.

          The development version of SPM8 includes functions for mesh handling. Could you have a look at those and judge whether they are of any use?

It can return the whole area but also per faces.\n\nAll the others are not dealing with reduction of points. I haven't really understood what spm_mesh_normals does.\n\nLilla"

However, here \nyou have to give a ratio for the reduction and not the desired number \nof points.\n\nBut in MNE when you setup the source space there is an option --ico. This option is reducing the source space in a way that it is using the topology of the recursively subdivided icosahedron. As a result, you can't reduced the points to any number but only to a set of numbers.\n(it is on page 22 and on page 98 in the tutorial).\n\n(But may you know this already.)\n\nLilla"

          Yes, I saw the matlab function mne_reduce_surface as well.

          I don't see a problem with the --ico option; I took --ico 4, leading to 2562 points per hemisphere, which is a decent number.

I just have drew the attention to the fact that there is a difference between how mne does and how FieldTrip does the reduction."

          the solution for bug 373 should be implemented throughout FT and fix 222
