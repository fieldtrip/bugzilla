          this would complement ft_volumereslice, but not interpolate. It could have

          cfg.flipdim = 1;  % could also be a vector
          cfg.permute = [1 3 2];

          it would first flip, then permute. The operations on the array are trivial, the corresponding adaptations of the transformation matrix are not completely trivial.

          Note that the lower level functionality already exists in private/volumeflip and private/volumepermute

          Although they don't seem to be currently used by higher level functions.

          Also, I think that align_ijk2xyz does what you suggest.

        thetext: This can be closed, since this has been implemented (already quite some time ago) in ft_volumereslice as cfg.method=flip.
