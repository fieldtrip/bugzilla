        thetext: this is probably a user error. please read the relevant tutorial documentation about coordinate systems etc and doing segmentations in fieldtrip. Your anatomical MRI needs to be registered in a coordinate system that fieldtrip understands. If it is already MNI, then coordsys= 'spm'.
