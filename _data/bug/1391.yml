        thetext: This is still prone to numerical accuracy issues. Ideally, the time-axis that is outputted by preproc should be just a subpart (in the case of padding) of the original time axis. Intermediate conversion should not be necessary

        thetext: In addition, the time axis that was created on the fly by ft_preprocessing does not seem to be correct.
