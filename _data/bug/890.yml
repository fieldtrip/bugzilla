          I've processed the CTF275 layout. The procedure is as follows:

          1) specify the bitmap you want to process and call ft_prepare_layout
          cfg.image = '*.bmp'
          lay = ft_prepare)layout(cfg)

          2) specify the channels
          tip: after every few electrodes/sensors, write down the names to not make mistakes when you've forgotten the selection sequence, e.g.
          label = {
          'MLF14'
          'MLF13'
          }

          3) specify the topographic interpolation boundaries

          4) specify the 'head' and sulci outlines

          5) copy your label onto the lay structure
          lay.label = label

          6) save the lay file into a matfile; e.g. 'CTF275.mat' and upload it (to here for instance)

          That'd be great yes. Oh, we really do want the layouts (figures) to also map the outlines and sulci. The biosemi electode positions are on the resp. website, I believe, just not the figs.

          Btw, I'm a bit lost on the easycap layouts. The ones you've sent me are different from the ones attached here, right? Do you know which ones we should include in the ft/template dir?

          Btw, I used the original FT outline&mask and scaled / moved my electrodes into these - I felt that this was easier, given that I already converted the picture files into a .lay.
          I could do a similar thing to the CTF275 layouts. That way, the outline will look nicer, because it is based on a 'perfect' circle rather than on human mouse clicks. Also, the nose and the ears will look nicer. Any reason why I should not do it?

        thetext: "Current status: \n- layouts that can refer to an image have been created (with positions and outline based on the image) and stored in a .mat file\n- all layouts have been documented at the wiki: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/template/layout\n- it remains a challenge to create new layouts for the MEG system as proper images are lacking. An attempt for the CTF system, based on the actual 3D positions, is added to the attachments (elproj_CTF275.m and .pdf).\n- http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/layout has been cleaned\n\n\nTo do:\n- clean up fieldtrip/template/layout: there are .lay files of which a .mat file exists (the .lay can be deleted in this case)\n- clean up ambiguous .lay files (e.g. language29ch-avg.lay and CTF275s.lay)\n- provide links (on the wiki) to the /template pages (e.g. on http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/layout)"

          Update:
          - fieldtrip/template/layout has been cleaned up
          - an overview of removed files (because duplicate and obsolete), but also up-to-date files can be found in the attached spreadsheet ('overview of layouts in template depository')
          - Eelke has added the feature to ft_prepare_layout to specify the layout without the need for an extension. e.g. cfg.layout = 'CTF151'; ft_prepare_layout will first try to find and load the corresponding .mat file. If this does not exist, it will try and load the corresponding .lay file
          - a link to /template/layout has been inserted in /tutorial/layout of the wiki
