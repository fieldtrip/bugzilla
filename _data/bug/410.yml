          I still got an issue with this, the read_eep_cnt function claims that it cannot open the file (I checked existence with Matlabs 'exist' function, and it works on Windows). 'could not open file' is a rather vague error message, might it be that there is a compatibility problem?

          I (finally) got new data from Amsterdam, and stumbled again onto this error - I put the corresponding file in \home\common\temporary\4robert

          And, the file is not mexed for win64 (and I should probably wait until the .dll problem is resolved)

          Anyhow, note that this is not a big problem for me, because I can go back to win32 matlab on which all works perfectly fine!

          it was an extremely clever move from me to post here how I can still use that function (win32)... should I see if I can compile it for win64?
          also note related bug 916, because I tried to remember how I could read in that data and tried platform glnx86 as a first guess

          it's way too much work to make it work for other platforms
          since I can work on win32, it doesn't bother me at it seems that none else has a problem with this
