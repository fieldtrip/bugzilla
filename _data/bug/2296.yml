I cannot seem to replicate your issue, in my case the component label is displayed correctly. \nRight now we cannot support 2013b, due to some low level changes Mathworks implemented (with many possible issues). Could you try again with an older version? Version 2012b is the latest version we support. \n\nIf this doesn't solve the issue, could you attach a small data example (preferable a few trials big) and a piece of code (can be in an m-file) that replicates the issue?"

          Dear B. Li

          Could you download todays FT version (which will be released this evening) and report back on whether your problem is resolved?

          thanks

It should auto-scale just fine, font units are set to be normalized on line 1698. \nI don't think it's a screen resolution thing. On my 1920x1200 monitor, even if my window is so tiny I that I see no data and only 1 button, the labels are still present (and totally unreadable of course). \n\nBesides, in component-mode only 10 are plotted, so the labels can never be to0 small (even in a tiny miniature databrowser).\n\nEven if I have use a 330 channel dataset, labels are still visible in a miniature window.\n\nSomething else is going on here."

          what is the unit of font size? Is it points as in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography) or pixels?

          Matlab's default units are in points, but in our case they are 'normalized', and are defined as a fraction of the figure height.

          From http://www.mathworks.nl/help/matlab/ref/text_props.html:


          FontUnits
          {points} | normalized | inches | centimeters | pixels

          Font size units. MATLAB uses this property to determine the units used by the FontSize property.

          -normalized — Interpret FontSize as a fraction of the height of the parent axes. When you resize the axes, MATLAB modifies the screen FontSize accordingly.

          -pixels, inches, centimeters, and points — Absolute units. 1 point = 1/72 inch.
          Note that if you are setting both the FontSize and the FontUnits in one function call, you must set the FontUnits property first so that MATLAB can correctly interpret the specified FontSize.


          I hadn't thought of the last bit, which is essential, and I just saw that in ft_plot_text it was in the wrong order (size before units). I fixed this just now and committed. Robert, can you check on your machine whether you still have the issue with adaptive fontsize? (i.e.: 'FontSize',.9/2/numel(chanindx). If not, I suggest we put the adaptive fontsize back in.

          and additionally, the GUI of the databrowser has become very very slow. It takes me 3-5 seconds to switch to the next trial or switch to the next set of channels.

        thetext: This is really odd, as Robert reverted to a fix font size a few weeks ago (before 20131010). Could you attach a small bit of the data and a bit of code that replicates the issue for you? I still cannot replicate the issue using our standard datasets. Additionally, which matlab version are you using? On what kind of windows/linux/osx version?

        thetext: btw, an alternative is to keep normalized units and change the fontsize. As Roemer copied from the help, normalized means a relative unit w.r.t the window (or axis?) size. 8 would be thus 8 time as much as the window is big. something lime .2/numel(chanindx) for the FontSize works fine for me.
