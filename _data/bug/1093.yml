        thetext: "Hello,\n\nWhen in interactive mode running artifact rejection, artifacts are still rejected when I manually set a less stringent z-threshold on the artifact rejection routine. So it seems ft does not update the to-be-rejected trials when the z-threshold is shifted.\n\nI guess you can replicate this using your own data. You could also check with the data I sent with the previous artifact rejection bug (bug 1027).\n\nBest, \n\nNiels"
