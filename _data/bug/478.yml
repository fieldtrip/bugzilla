          # This post-commit script synchronizes multiple files in the same
          # repository, i.e. if you change and commit file1 in directoryA, then
          # file1 in directoryB is also updated. It can be used to replicate
          # identical versions of files at multiple locations in the repository.
          #
          # This script serves as a replacement for svn file externals, which
          # are very slow and require a lot of resources on the server when
          # used with svn+ssh.
