          Calls to ft_dipolefitting crash due to ft_convert_units making calls to the functions shiftdata and unshiftdata which are only provided by the Fixed-Point Toolbox.  This appears to be a recent change as an older version of FieldTrip (fieldtrip-20110818) does not make these calls.  Would it be possible to change the code so as to not require licensing of this toolbox?

          Thanks!

          Joe

          Hi Joe, sorry about this. The change is from Jan 17, 2012 (revision 5144) where some new code was incorporated into ft_convert_units to deal with another problem (bug1112). (by the way, my shiftdata seems to be in the signal-toolbox)

          From looking at the code, it seems as if the shiftdata/unshiftdata functionality requested can be replaced by calls to permute/ipermute (or even something completely different (I did not think that through...))

          @Boris: could you have a look at this please and fix it with functions that are not in any of mathworks' add-on toolboxes?

          Thanks.
