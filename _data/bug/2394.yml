          I am in the process of deprecating ft_selectdata_old, so the discrepancy between the two will become irrelevant, and I don't want to spend time in updating ft_selectdata_old.

          How do you numerically index zero trials?

          (In reply to comment #2)
          Agreed, we can forget about _old. It's just that I encountered the bug while using that one (but have now switched to _new).

          I also started out with logical indexing (finding the bug). Then I switched to numerical indexing, simply by wrapping the logical with a find() before passing on to ft_selectdata. This as the introduction to: numerically indexing 0 trials would be passing []. Reopening as _new fails in this case.

          what's the datatype in the input?
          For me it works, but I can imagine that it does not work for 'raw', because I forgot to commit a change to selfromraw (just did so in r.8874). Could you close the bug if it now works?

        thetext: Yep, works now. I will change the test script to only check _new, and add an error to _old in case someone specifies [] or false(N,1), just to be sure no one gets weird results (it gave me a hard time for a few hours :) ).
