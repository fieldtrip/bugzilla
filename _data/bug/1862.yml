          Using:
          datasets = ref_datasets;
          test_ft_preprocessing(datasets,1);
          test_ft_timelockanalysis(datasets,1);
          test_ft_freqanalysis(datasets,1);
          test_ft_componentanalysis(datasets,1);
          test_ft_sourceanalysis(datasets,1);

          It might be that one the above fails for a certain dataset.

          Probably, and hopefully ;), this is the cause of many bugs on the dashboard.

          We also need to remove the current plexon data, the path can be found in ref_datasets (which is update).

          Thomas Hartman (Trento) has some plexon data, and he also has updated/better read-functions (?). Asking him for (part of) the data as a reference dataset will also help in making it easier to contribute/work-on the read-functions.

          Was the test batch also run again?

          I was hoping for a lot of passed on the dashboard, most still fail:

          If the test batch was indeed run again, it's time to look at the scripts again :)
