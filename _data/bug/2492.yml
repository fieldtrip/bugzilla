        thetext: There is a snippet of code currently commented out that implements 'graded' masking (using alphadata), but it is not used. The current masking relies fully on NaN'ing bits of the data that should be masked out (so it will be ignored during plotting), and does not use alphadata.

        thetext: "I made this bug because I wanted to implement transparency masking via saturation, and it would make sense to \"unlock\" it for opacity masking as well (which was disabled). \n\nThe first will not work I realized last year, it was misconception it could have. I see no need to continue for the opacity case. \n\nIf I do at some point I'll reopen ;)"
