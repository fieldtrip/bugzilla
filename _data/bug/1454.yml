          I did the following changes:

          - all info from dataformat/meg and dataformat/spike is put into the specific getting started pages
          - links on site dataformat point to the specific getting started pages

          Therefore, the dataformat/meg and dataformat/spike pages can be deleted. But I would not  like to delete them until I can not see which other pages have links to these sites. (see bug1946)
