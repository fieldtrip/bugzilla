Instead, if you give a component strucutre to ft_databrowser, then no need to specify viewmode, as cfg.viewmode defaults to 'component' anyway."

        thetext: "In attempting to re-do the figure to show ft_databrowser rather than ft_component browser, I ran into 2 issues:\n\n1) I could not find the recommended 'datfile.mat' to load 'data' from.  It was not included in ArtifactRemoval.zip.   Should it be?   \n\n2) I could of course re-create the preprocessed data using the example code, but then does this ICA section want the downsampled 'data' or 'data_orig'?   I tried both, but the results from 'data' were rubbish, but using 'data_orig' gave something reasonable.\n\n3) Anytime ICA is run, it gives a different result; i.e. no way to replicate exactly the components and figures already on the wiki.  I see some similar components (compared to the wiki) from running it once...should I create new figures with the new result I have obtained?  (However, this will also affect the rest of the tutorial as well, as to which components match the ECG)....or just leave the 'old' figure to avoid redoing all this?  (Or, it would e easy to remake figure if original 'comp' is still around...)."

        thetext: Answer was that the figure on the wiki is 'good enough' (close enough) to what is meant to be depicted with the new databrowser, so no change needed on the wiki, given that the original 'comp' cannot be recreated.
