          Created attachment 374
          testdata was source analized time locked data with 'lcmv'

          I tried this for the testdata then I got following error.

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method = 'ortho';%'slice';
          cfg.funparameter  = 'avg.pow';
          figure
          ft_sourceplot(cfg,testdata);


          ??? error ==> reshape
          Quantity of elements shouldn't change to reshape

          error  ==> ft_sourceplot at 463
                fun     = reshape(fun, [dim numel(data.time)]);

          error  ==> sourceplot at 18
          [varargout{1:nargout}] = funhandle(varargin{:});


          The problem is to reshape data.avg.pow with time dimension, despite it doesn't have the time dimension.

          (In reply to comment #0)

          This is part of a bigger bug that will be fixed at a later time.
          For now the solution would be to remove the 'time' field from the data, e.g.:

          testdata=rmfield(testdata,'time')

          would make it work.

          The avg.pow parameter does not vary over time, therefore the time  dimension is not needed.
