      thetext: "Dear Field-trippers\nI recently ran some time frequency analysis using the wavelet method.\nI was surprise to see that whereas I asked for a step of 1Hz, it was not\nthe case every alternate step (for foi=2:1:10 ; I got [2 3.2 4 5.2 6 7.2 8\n9.2 10]), and it was also the case when I changed the toi (2.5, 1.5 with\nconstant trials length of 2.5 sec and sampling freq 1000Hz).\nI found a kind of explanation following the faq\n(http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/why_does_my_output.freq_not_match_my_cfg.foi_when_using_wavelet_formerly_wltconvol_in_ft_freqanalyis).\nStill it is not clear to me why this refers to Fourier transform.\nFrom my (none specialist) point of view it is possible to produce a    \nwavelet of any size (Hz;Dt).\nIt is clear that there is some limitations based on the duration of the\nepochs and the number of time points. But in the present case it shouldn't\nbe a problem, is it?\n    Would be please if someone can help me with this issue.\n    Thanks in advance\n\n    Manuel\n\n\n-> this also holds for the corresponding faq about mtmconvol"
