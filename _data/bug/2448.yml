          well seen, thanks.

          I suggest to not change the actual default, as people's scripts might rely on it. Rather we should fix the documentation to be consistent with the code.

          ft_preproc_bandpass uses 6 default filter order but ft_preproc_bandstop uses 4 as default. Should I change it to 6 (as for highpass and low pass) or leave it as it is?
