        thetext: This has been reported by Hanneke Meeren. I did not check myself, but I guess that this is related to the change to the new listserver. Is there a way to recover the old archive?

          I have the old archives in the format Listserv provides (which isn't compatible with mailman). The archives can be made available again, but I'm still working on getting it in a usable format...

          I expect it to be available again sometime in January

          The archive has been extended with the old archive, so most (I removed some out of office e-mails) of the mails in the old archive are now available again.

          I'll close the bug now...
