        thetext: "E.g., I'm flipping through trials while adjusting the y-scaling to see something a little better, and suddenly the scaling reverts to what it was a couple of trials ago, or it flips to trial 10-trials back. \n\nIt seems this is actually stupidly easy to fix. Currently, the figure property Interruptible is on. This allows callbacks to be executed regardless of whether another callback is being executed. This allows key presses to be executed while the browser is still busy processing the previous command. For example, a y-scaling command can then adjust the scaling using the plotting data of the previous trial, saving it into the figure, while the browser is still busy processing the previous move-trial command. And vice versa. \n\nWhen a redraw takes a second or two, this can easily result in like 10 commands being attempted to execute simultaneously. \n\nBy setting the property to off, and by keeping the BusyAction property at 'queue' (the default), this no longer happens. Callbacks are only run sequentially. \n\nChecking with a previous matlab and pull requesting."

        thetext: Pull requested. This had been annoying since forever about the browser, happy to see it's so easy to fix.
