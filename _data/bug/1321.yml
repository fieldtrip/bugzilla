        thetext: "ft_sourcedescriptives uses svdfft for the estimation of the optimal orientation, both for frequency domain and time domain source reconstruations.\n\nInternally, the csd/covariance is computed, and an svd is performed. As far as the frequency domain is concerned, the csd is correctly estimated from f*f' where f are the 'raw' fourier coefficients. \nYet, it is questionable whether the same applies for the covariance, (mom*mom') where mom is the 3D-dipole moment as a function of time. The mom is not necessarily zero mean. Does this yield a sub-optimal covariance estimate? (and thus a sub-optimal estimate of the optimal dipole orientation?).\n\nNote: this non-zero mean issue also arises in the computation of the source.avg.cov (mom*mom'), and the determination of optimal orientation in ft_sourceanalysis (cfg.fixedori = 'yes').\n\nI would suggest to adjust svdfft with an optional extra flag which specifies whether the data need to be de-meaned, or to implement a svdmom (probably cleaner, because svdfft is specifically designed for freq-domain analysis and it hacked its way into the time-domain code too)."

          Hi JM

          I just finished discussions with the FIL team on SPM12. There are some relevant plans that also impact fieldtrip, esp. on the source estimation (ft_inverse_xxx) and the post-processing of the estimations.

          Please postpone any actions until we have discussed this in detail (i.e next week).

          best
          Robert
