          Burkhard Maess just pointed these two things out:

          (a) Figure 3, magenta line, cannot have been produced by a bandpass-filter, but a bandstop-filter

          (b) The statement "Over the whole interval, the 50Hz power is now zero. However, looking at a short piece at the begin, there is non-zero power at 50Hz." is impossible, because if power is zero in total, it cannot be non-zero at specific points in time.

          For (a), it took me some time to find why the code on the page actually produces that figure, but then I found that the sampling frequency is 1000 Hz in the beginning, but set to 10000 Hz when computing the filter.

          I'll fix both now, first change the code and exchange the figure and second, change the phrasing of that statement so that it is correct.

        thetext: oh and also, I guess a "notch"-filter is not the same as a dftfilter? That one went wrong at various places throughout that faq, so I corrected for that as well

          (In reply to Jörn M. Horschig from comment #2)

          A notch filter is the name often used for a bandstop filter with a very narrow stopband.

It's like the big-bang, which started with random ripples in the space-time-fabric (not that it is really related ;-)"

          hmm, interesting, let me think about that...

          btw, I thought I had already changed the phrasing in the faq to use amplitude rather than power
