        thetext: "Biosemi2ft has undefined state for the split-trigger config option if not specified. See email exchange below.\n\n---\n\nDear Boris,\n    I'm pleased to report that progress has been made. First let me say that your assessment was spot on. I looked at SignalConfiguration.c and saw the problem you were talking about, and I thought that that seemed like a reasonable culprit for the problem. I reasoned that if this was in fact the source of the issue, then it should be the case that if I included the splittrigger configuration option, the problem might be overcome. This is exactly what happened. Once I uncommented the splittrigger line in the config file, the triggers were detected by ft_realtime_synchronous (however, I immediately ran into the problem that the function 'offset2time' that is called on line 162 of ft_realtime_synchronous is not accessible from that function --likely because it is in the fieldtrip\\private folder, so I imagine if I move ft_realtime_synchronous from the fieldtrip\\realtime\\tutorial folder up to the main fieldtrip folder I should be fine). This problem and subsequent bugs should be no problem for me to sort out now that I'm at least getting the triggers in). I am just going to leave the splittrigger configuration option in there since it makes no difference to me, but it might be a good idea to patch up SignalConfiguration.c moving forward so that it handles this more smoothly. \n    Many thanks again for taking the time to look at this for me. I know well how much time and effort goes into debugging code like this (especially remotely).\n\nKind wishes,\nAdam\n\n\n\nOn 05-Jan-2012 05:48, Boris Reuderink wrote:\nDear Adam (CC: Robert Oostenveld),\n\nIt took a look at your problem, and made the following observations so far:\n\n# FT's recorder.exe\nOdd that recording.exe did not generate any data... maybe this is a separate issue, maybe it is not. I take it that the command you used to record the stream to disk are in ft_realtime_debug_command.png, with left the recorder, and on the right the command to read the data from the amplifier, and write it simultaneously to a .gdf and a buffer?\nI took a look at the source for recorder.exe, and it does not seem to contain output that would help us to identify the problem --- based on the screenshot I cannot judge if it recorded data at all.\n\n# Biosemi2ft\nWhen I look at the output of biosemi2ft, the format of the trigger display lines indicate that it assumes *a split trigger format*. This is odd, since the config file does not specify a split trigger format. I hunted through the code, and in realtime/buffer/cpp/SignalConfiguration the value is read from a file if it exists, *but apparently it is not initialized*. This could mean that it will get initialized to a random state.\n\nBefore I continue, could you confirm that this is a more or less correct assessment?\n\nBest,\n\nBoris"
