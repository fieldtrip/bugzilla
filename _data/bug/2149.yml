          Hi Jim,

          I think we should leave in the hz.ds folders. These are related to the head localization before and after the measurement. They are not used but also don't take up a lot of space.

          (In reply to comment #3)

          the SAM folders are some remnants of a SAM beamformer analysis that was perfomed on this data using the CTF software. So they do not contain the original data, but some (probably failed) analysis results.

          In that case I guess someone already removed the SAM folders and forgot to update the bug on bugzilla. The only sub-directories in the Subject0X folders/zip-files (in /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data and ../ftp/tutorial) are hz.ds and hz2.ds, that's why I thought those were the SAM folders.

          I'll re-add the hz and hz2 folders to the zip-files and I'll change the bug to resolved.
