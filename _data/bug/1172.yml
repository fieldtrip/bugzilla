          I am using Fieldtrip for realtime P300 classification.
          i am facing one problem that i am unable to read Events (stimulus markers from Vision recorder)

          my flashing program is in Visual c, that communicates with vision recorder and markers are displayed correctly in VisionRec.
          while reading from buffer i get data correctly but it doesn't gives me events.

          the command

          event     = read_event(cfg.dataset, 'minsample', prevSample+1);

          gives me an empty vector.

          I am using
           FT_REALTIME_BRAINAMPPROXY to read from Vision recorder.
          with default setting i.e

          cfg.port=51244;cfg.target.datafile      = 'buffer://localhost:1972'
          cfg.target.eventfile     = 'buffer://localhost:1972'


          after that if i use ft_realtime_signalviewer it displays data correctly but it shows no event.

          Dear Abdullah Khalid,

          Could you provide some extra info needed for reproduction of this bug:
          - What platform(s) do you run the acquistion on?
          - Which version of FieldTrip do you use?
          - What version of Matlab do you use?
          - Could you list specifics of you amplifier?

          Further, could you describe a series of minimal steps to reproduce your problem? For example 1) start this program on this computer, 2) start start attached script on this computer.

          Best regards,

          Boris Reuderink

          Dear Abdulla Khalid,

          Thank you for this clear explanation. Bug 1164 seems related to your problem,
          and we are working hard to resolve this issue.

          You sent a stimulation program (P300.exe). Unfortunately, we cannot debug with
          executables that are not included with FieldTrip. Would you be so kind to
          record the network stream that is created by BrainVision Recorder during your
          experiment? We could then replay it locally to simulate your issue.

          You can record such a stream with the tool "netcat". On a linux/unix computer,
          you can use a command like:

          $ netcat <ip address> 51244 > bug1182-tcpdump.dat

          where <ip address> is the ip address of the computer that runs BrainVision
          Recorder.

          A version of netcat is available for Windows at http://joncraton.org/blog/46
          --- note that your virus scanner might complain that it is a hacking tool since
          it can be used to setup a server as well.

          If this is unclear, please don't hesitate to ask for help.

          Best regards,

          Boris Reuderink

          (In reply to comment #5)
          The netcat command looks garbled, and refers to an unrelated bug. It should be:

          $ netcat IPADDRESS 51244 > bug1172-tcpdump.dat

          where IPADDRESS is the ip address of the computer running BrainVision Recorder.
