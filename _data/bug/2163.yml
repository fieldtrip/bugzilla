          I think I found a potential bug in read_neuralynx_nse that, at least in our case is affecting the way that how we can read spikes in our dataset.  The problem is in line 43 in which the value 112 in record size variable is hard coded. This is critical because if you have a size of the waveform that is different (as it is in our case), it changes the framework to look for spikes. I guess, one way to solving is to use the value that should be present at the header. If the data is saved using the function ft_write_spike; then, you can specify the record size, which is stored at the header

          Hi Conrado,

          Can you attach a test file with a recordsize that is different from 112?

          thanks
          Robert

          thanks for the file. I implemented a test script and resolved the problem as suggested.
