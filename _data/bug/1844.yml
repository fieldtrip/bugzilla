        thetext: following on Robert's BBM today, there was a request to have a section on the wiki where users can list methods they would like implemented (or the last 5% of work done in order to make a partially implemented method fully usable), along with a 'like' button so other users can vote to prioritize this wish list.

Would bugzilla be the place where people would vote?"

          Something like this feels at home on facebook of course ;), but than we risk ignoring a large part (majority?) of our userbase. Maybe an idea is to just do this via the mailing list? I assume there is a doodle-like-voting-tool out there for this. A quick google for 'online poll' led me to:
