          Created attachment 816
          Love Laws & Outlaws tells the story of a young couple who overcome the trials and tribulations thrown at them by society, to hold on to the one thing that matters to them more than their lives.

          A love story of a couple hailed from an orthodox society with lots of restrictions and how they overcome from all the trials and tribulations thrown on them. Their depth of love, their affection and care towards each other took them to the next level of love. The story tells you how a small chaos moved to a lovely date and then to a long relationship called marriage which changed their lives.

          I am surprised, indoo seth is an actual person:

          the pdf is most likely a virus anyway ;)
