Please \nreplace data.grad with the original grad-structure obtained after \nreading the header.\n\nThe FIXME states that the code tries to identify if two channels \nuse the same coil. This is certainly not the case for Yokogawa \nsystems: Each coil is per definition only assigned to a single \nchannel. I am happy to help in fixing this block of code, but would \nlike to disable it immediately until it is fixed as I am testing \nYokogawa input routines at present.\n\nRegards, Till"

          Hi Till,

          We have 1 yokogawa160 dataset as a test set at the Donders Centre, and for this one it seems to just work. Did you do additional stuff such as denoising or component rejection?

        thetext: "Hi Jan-Mathijs,\n\nI add the file, which produces the crash. It is from our\nMEG system. The problem is related to Bug 804: At present\nall reference channels are added to the grad-structure and\nfor Yokogawa systems the reference channels do not have\na valid position information (it is always zero, see attached \nfile channels 126-128). I want to remove the reference channels\nfrom the grad-structure anyway and then the problem disappears.\nBut if the FIXME code block is ever used for Yokogawa440 systems\nthen it will not work as they are mixed planar/axial gradiometer\nsystems. \n\nRegards, Till"

          I think the bug can be closed as channelposition.m works only
          with the old grad structure and I was not able to reproduce the crash
          using the new Yokogawa toolbox and corresponding code in FT.
