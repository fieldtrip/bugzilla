        thetext: With the small team in Nijmegen and the increasing number of "external" contributions, we should make it easier to integrate the external contributions. Furthermore, we should make it more manageable to develop without committing immediately to the release version. Hence we should move to git, which means that I want to move to github.

        thetext: "On http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/why_is_fieldtrip_maintained_in_svn_and_not_in_git are some details that outline why we use svn. Those are to be kept in mind while migrating.\n\nin short:\n\n1 dashboard\n2 general access control\n3 access control for fieldtrip/external\n4 hooks\n\nThe dashboard should change anyway, since right now it is too late in catching errors (only in the release). It should be possible to test the whole batch of scripts against the pre-release version before merging it with the release version. Probably the automation of the dashboard should be abandoned. Right now it automatically runs batches of test scripts, updates http://fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/dashboard and sends an email to fieldtrip-dev a few times a week. If any, then the future dashboard should be based on something like https://travis-ci.org\n\nGeneral access control is not a problem with github. Only a few people (right now only me, but could be extended) would need write/management access to fieldtrip/fieldtrip, most people would work on their own branch and send me pull requests.\n\nSpecific access control to fieldtrip/external cannot be maintained. We should check documentation and make sure that it is explained how to deal with external code (i.e. make changes upstream). \n\nThe hooks are the most challenging feature to replicate on github. I'll write a separate comment for that."

          If we are talking about github website it also supports SVN clients. So in principle it should be possible to work as before.

We already have a presence on https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/ for quite some time, bot so far code would always be committed first to svn, and from there (under an administrative account) be pushed to github. In the future the code suggestions can be comittted to github by the core development team, or \"pull requests” from all contributors can be made and easily merged by the core team. The organization of the code itself is not going to change.\n\nIf you still have local changes to your svn copy of FieldTrip, please commit these changes to the svn repository or remember them. Next week Wednesday (3 Feb) I will disable write access to the svn server and enable wite access for the core development team to the github repository. From that moment on all code changes and contributions should be committed to github. \n\n--------"

          regarding

          1 dashboard
          2 general access control
          3 access control for fieldtrip/external
          4 hooks


          1) this is in practice disabled now, since there will not be any new svn commits. I'll have to reimplement it for git and will probably open a new bug for it.
          2) this is now through reviewing pull requests and the development team
          3) identical as 2
          4) the twitter and gitsync hook are reimplemented (running on a raspberry pi in my basement)

          I still need to update wiki documentation (mainly delete svn stuff) and I still have to update the ftp and the /home/common releases. Right now, those releases will remain stuck on the latest svn version (revision 11162).
