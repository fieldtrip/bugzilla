          for a slave, it only makes sense to see the master, where the master and zombie could still see all. This requires changes in the discover code.

          probably this will save ~1% CPU usage for all command-line peerslaves

        thetext: "I am closing this bug because the development on the fieldtrip/peer toolbox will be put onto hold in favor of the fieldtrip/qsub toolbox. The qsub toolbox is more promising for the DCCN as a whole and hence requires attention. \n\nThe peer toolbox will remain available within fieldtrip, and external contributions to the  code will be considered for inclusion.\n\nIn the future, the development on fieldtrip/peer may be started up again and the bugs that I hereby close as \"wontfix\" can be revisited."
