          as I said, works for me ;)
          the only thing that does not change in butterfly viewmode is that the numbers actually range from 0 to 1, always, but the signal scales correctly

          well, indeed, that is what is meant. I still see that as a bug though ;-)
          Also does not work in vertical mode.

          I see, I can change it in butterfly viewmode - I thought the scaling does not work for you :)

          but what does not work in vertical viewmode? It all works for me there - note that the y-axis is intentionally replaced by channel labels instead of numbers

        thetext: ah, i see. I am only plotting one channel in vertical mode and expect yaxis to show amplitude. Which would make sense. I can also change to butterfly mode though if that works. Thanks!

          fiiiiiixed

           - in vertical viewmode, I re-added values on the y-axis. there was something strange in the code that suggested them to be there, but before plotting them, the corresponding variable was cleared... no clue why

           - in butterfly viewmode, just added the scaling, which rescales when rescaling ;)
