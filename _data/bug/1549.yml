        thetext: "Today, Maarten Hogervorst mentioned that at they have added reading code for a file format recorded from a gTec amplifier to FieldTrip. This format is TNO specific, but the aim is to continue to use this format in the future. \n\nWe could consider including the code so that TNO does not have to maintain their own version of FieldTrip. Potentially, it could be used to replace the format identified with 'gtec_mat', which is --- if I am informed correctly --- also TNO specific.\n\nI have attached the changes in patch form for SVN revision 6112."
