          The current implementation of MNE (actually the ft_sourceanalysis function) can deal with the combination freq data/mne method by calling the function freq2timelock that converts the data structure in a (fake) timelock structure.

          The all procedure doesn't give errors but the output should be transformed back to a freq structure (through timelock2freq), currently it doesn't and therefore the output of the all analysis doesn't make any sense.

          From some comments in the documentation of timelock2freq ( "% hmmm... I have no idea whether this is correct", "% reconstruct something that spans the same space as the fft of the data, hmmm...") it seems that the author didn't have a completely clear idea of what he/she was doing :p

          Anyway I think that we could avoid this hack altogether and write down a more elegant implementation, what do you think Robert?

          (In reply to Luca Ambrogioni from comment #1)

          freq2timelock should not be used, that is a last resort for converting freq into timelock in cases where it is unexpected. It completely messes up the channel structure, since frequencies are mapped along channels, e.g.

          {
          'Cz@10Hz'
          'Cz@11Hz'
          'Cz@12Hz'
          'Cz@13Hz'
          'Cz@14Hz'
          'Pz@10Hz'
          'Pz@11Hz'
          'Pz@12Hz'
          'Pz@13Hz'
          'Pz@14Hz'
           ...
          }

          The data should be handled properly as freq throughout.

          I finished to update the MNE code for the freq input (I will submit it soon). Now the high level function "ft_sourceanalysis" should be updated accordingly:

          -the Fourier spectrum input should be fed to "minimumnormestimate" as a channel times trials (or tapers) complex matrix

          -the cross-spectral density input should be fed as a CSD matrix.

          The code can automatically detect whether the input is a timeseries (real), fourier coefficients (complex) or a CSD (square, Hermitian and complex).

          The freq2timelock function should not be called anymore. For now, a single frequency should be selected.

          Committed revision 10330.

          I have made some updates to ft_sourceanalysis, which hopefully don't break the rest of the functionality. Right now, it should pass on the fourierspctrm to minimumnormestimate. I did not change minimumnormestimate because Luca has a version of his lined up to be committed. Could you pass that to me for a quick quality check so that we can commit, and continue working on it?

          Note: the other methods 'rv' and 'music' need to be addressed as well.

          Now all the source reconstruction methods (except for music) are implemented for frequency domain data.Right now they need a single frequency as input, therefore do not output the ful soure-level spectrum.

          I think that this "bug" is ready to be closed.

          Could you update the test script to demonstrate that the time-domain and the frequency domain reconstructions are identical (up to a scaling constant) in case you generate time-series data that consists of a sine-wave modulated scalp topography?
