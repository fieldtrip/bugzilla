          More of a suggestion related to the runica output stored by ft_componentanalysis than a bug.

          Why not include in the output of ft_componentanalysis the mean IC variance output from runica?

          discussed in ft-meeting: will we add this as extra field in the output? How difficult is it to compute from the output? Otherwise, we could also document how to compute it. It's probably not something many people will use anyway.
          Let's continue discussing when Robert is there.

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
