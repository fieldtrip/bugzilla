          I suggest to remove the one from fileio and only keep the one in compat. Agreed?

Agreed?\n\nThanks Robert; I would agree it seems best to store the files only in compat and remove the fileio/matlablt2010b directory (after moving the @uint64 directory). \n\nAs a side note: it would be good to re-compile the mex files in @uint64, in particular max.c and min.c, as the following does still crash Matlab on my machine:\n\n    cd fileio/matlablt2010b\n    x=uint64(zeros(0,1))\n    max(x)\n\nwhere the fix for the .c (but not .mex*) files was contributed earlier in commit 3e02cc6eda9acfcb6bc865c188b6ae4373de6989 [1] part of github PR #78 [2].\n\n[1] https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/3e02cc6e\n[2] https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/78"

          No, I run OSX 64 bit.
