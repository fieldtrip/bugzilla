        thetext: right now, all topos are scaled according to minmax of all plotted topos. it would be much better to see maxima and minima within topos themselves rather than across topos.

          Which function are you referring to? Databrowser with component viewmode, or ft_topoplotIC?

          In general I actually don't agree with you, I think having the same color limits across different plots is the way to go.

          True, as long as it does not become the default ;)

          default is 'global' scaling using 'maxmin'
          The previous default was some kind of mix between maxmin and maxabs: Every topography was scaled by it's own absolute maximum, but by MATLAB default the color scheme was adjusted according to the global minimum and maximum
