        thetext: The matlab implementation is actually pretty fast already (unless there are no trials and just 2 very long vectors of spike times, in case it needs to use a slower version) - perhaps we should stick with that one

        thetext: Nothing has happend in the past 3.5, making this a very low priority issue. Since it's mentioned that the working non-mex version seems to work fine enough, I suggest to close this one. Feel free to re-open if there's somebody who'd like to push this forward
