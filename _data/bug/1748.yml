          spike data

          The reading of spike data from neurosim is very inefficient. It reads the file line by line.
          My suggestion is to replace 'read_neurosim_spikes' (in /fileio/private/)  with the attached function.
          It uses the matlab function 'textscan' and is a lot faster, since textscan has the built-in functionality to skip comment lines and irrelevant columns in the data.

          tic
          spike = ft_read_spike('/.');
          toc

          reading a reasonably large datafile (~34000 lines, ~4MB, added as attachment) takes 31.6 seconds on my mentat node using the old 'read_neurosim_spikes'.
          whereas the new version only takes 0.56 seconds
