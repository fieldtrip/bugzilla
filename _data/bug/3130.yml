          Hi Diego,

          For me it works at this moment.

          Might it be due to http://mailman.science.ru.nl/pipermail/fieldtrip/2016-May/010420.html

          I.e. perhaps I have blocked your IP address. I just unblocked all IP addresses, could you check again?

          Now I can! Thank you Robert. I promise I'll never attack again the fieldtrip wiki ;)

        thetext: It had been blocked for me at my work IP for the past couple weeks also (and I have an open call with my IT support for it), but I knew the site wasn't down as I could access it from other places.   Now I can again access it from work.  Thank you!  My work IP is 147.188.22.18; please do not block again. :-)

        thetext: "(In reply to Diego Lozano Soldevilla from comment #4)\n\nI had accumulated a list of bad IP addresses over the years, but recently Rene noticed the web server sending spam. Not sure whether that was due to the fieldtriptoolbox site or another. But I added a lot of recent IP addresses to the blacklist from which I had detected what seemed failed login attempts. I guess that you (perhaps automatically) login on the wiki, hence your addresses were probably incorrectly detected.\n\nThe long list of IP addresses in the blacklist is undesirable any way. Better would be to upgrade the wiki system to a recent version (with bug and security fixes), but I tried (see bug 2223) and failed to get it to work with the fieldtrip template. So we would start again with a very plain layout.  \n\nI'll close this bug, but bug 2223 remains open."
