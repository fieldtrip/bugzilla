          Hi Roemer,
          Can this be reproduced? Otherwise I suggest to wontfix this.

          It can be replicated by:
          load('/home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp/tutorial/cluster_permutation_freq/dataFIC.mat')
          cfg = [];
          cfg.layout = 'CTF151.lay';
          cfg.method = 'summary';
          ft_rejectvisual(cfg,dataFIC);
          And then plotting a random trial by putting a trial number in the 'plot trial' box and hitting enter. Error ending up in ft_checkdata.

          Assigning to me.

        thetext: "In ft_checkdata's raw2timelock subfunction, the time axis is being reconstructed after counting the number of samples pre and postzero. The error is caused by the reconstructed time-axis having 1 sample less than the actual time-axis, thus causing an indexing error later on. \n\nThe miscounting itself is caused by numerical inaccuracies in the time-axis. Sampling/resampling rate of the tutorial data is 300Hz, and there is some machine noise surrounding the time-steps. \nReconstructing the time-axis by mint:mean(diff(time)):maxt skips the last sample, because it is less than mean(diff(time)) away from the previous sample. \n\nSo, in short, the problem is caused by an 'irrational' fractional time-step (infinite decimals). I guess we deal with this kind of thing in other places as well, and I'm not sure whether this is the appropriate place for a 'fix'. \n\n\nNote, this is not related to bug 1477."

        thetext: "After discussing this in the ft-meeting, it became clear that the code where the sample was lost was part of the fix for bug 1477. \nBecause the underlying issue was related to a 'irrational' sampling rate and/or numerical error in the time-axis, I tried to find a way to correct for this. \n\nHowever, any 'irrational' sampling rate (either truly irrational like 1/3 or numerically close to irrational like 1/278) will always lead to difference in time-steps of at least eps. \nI.e.: numel(unique(diff(time)))~=1. \nI do not think there is a way around this, unless we want to set a limit on the precision of the sampling rate. \nHowever, this brings back *dumdumdummmm* the fsample field from deprecation. If we decide to at some point, a time-axis fix can be implemented in ft_datatype_raw's fixtimeaxes subfunction.\n\nConsidering it unlike we would ever do that (right?), I fixed the problem with irrational sampling rates in raw2timelock, ft_checkdata.\n\nSetting as fixed, more info in bug1477."

          I am strongly in favour of bringing back fsample! It should never have been deprecated in the first place. It just makes life so much easier. As said in the meeting, I always add it back anyway, because I like to be able to do stuff like

          cfg = [];
          cfg.toilim = [1 2-1/data.fsample];
          data = ft_redefinetrial(cfg, data);

          to select exactly 1s of data (speeds up fft tremendously).

          hehehe, I always do:

          cfg = [];
          cfg.toilim = [1 2-mean(diff(data.time{1}))];
          data = ft_redefinetrial(cfg, data);

          This also speeds up the fft ;-)

          or just do:
          cfg.padding = ceil(max(cellfun(@numel,data.time))./data.fsample);
          freq = ft_freqanalysis(cfg,data)

          To get a nice integer multiples in 1 freq-axis ;). @Jorn: hint! ;p



          Actually, if you're aiming for fast fft's, shouldn't it be a power of 2?
          cfg.padding = 2^nextpow2(max(cellfun(@numel,data.time))) ./ data.fsample;
