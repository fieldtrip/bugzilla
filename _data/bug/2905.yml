          I've *.smr files generated by Spike2 software but I cannot read them:

          >> ft_read_header(filename)
          Undefined function 'mexprog' for input arguments of type 'double'.

          Error in ns_SetLibrary (line 39)
          [ns_RESULT] = mexprog(18, filename);
          Error in read_ced_son (line 93)
              ns_RESULT = ns_SetLibrary(which('nsCedSon.dll'));

          Error in ft_read_header (line 469)
              orig = read_ced_son(filename,'readevents','no','readdata','no');

          I was able to open the same file using low level routing from sigTOOL matlab toolbox under linux. To solve this issue, I could open an if ispc/isunix statement in read_ced_son line 92 to open the linux implementation. I'd have to add sigTOOL low level functions (plus other modifications) that I'd add to the new fieldtrip/external/sigTOOL folder.

          Does it make sense to you?

        thetext: "I believe that this format was once upon a time implemented by Gijs, and subsequently somehow adopted/used by Vladimir (now CC on this bug). \n\nThe ns_SetLibrary is from neuroshare, which is not supported any more (only on old 32 bit windows matlab).\n\nI would be fine with replacing it altogether with a new matlab-only implementation based on http://sigtool.sourceforge.net. E.g. add a fieldtrip/external/sigtool directory, add it to ft_hastoolbox and then use that instead of the existing mex file solution (which I think won't work for anyone)."

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #1)
          Thanks Robert! I'll work on that.
