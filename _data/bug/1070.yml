          Hi Freek, could you specify a bit more the background, or even upload a small dataset that allows us to reproduce the problem? I was thinking of a 3 trial dataset and the cfg-structure you used for calling ft_freqanalysis. This should be the minimum required stuff.
          For now, I did not see any changes in the recent past that directly affected line 587 so at the moment it is hard to figure out what's going on.

          BW, JM

Nevertheless I managed to get some grip on the problem:\n\nI am using planar gradient data. I give ft_frequanalysis a cfg containing a selection of the channels I am interested in. When I give a selection using a vector with channel-numbers I get the error. When I use a vector of channel-strings, it works. Importantly, while I give 40 strings, output of freqanalysis is 38 planar channels (it thus was not able to do freqanalysis on one pair of planar gradients). The fact that 1 pair of planar-gradient-channels does not come through is, as I assume, the reason of the error. The bug is thus when using channel-numbers to specify planar-gradient channels.\n\nHope this helps you further. I can go further by using channel-labels rather than numbers.\n\nThanks!\n\nFreek"

          Hi Freek,

          Could you try uploading a small dataset again that replicates the error?
