          As discussed during the last bug binge, it would be good to make a distinction in functionality for the plotting of source-level data, between ft_sourceplot and ft_sourcemovie. The former should accept scalar data, the latter should accept higher dimensional data. The distinction between support for data defined on a volumetric grid, or on a cortical sheet should eventually disappear.

          This bug is a place holder to keep track  of the revamping of ft_sourcemovie.

          My initial intention was to first clean up the existing code and take it from there. Yet, I think step 0 should be to investigate Joern's early attempts to make a general purpose movie function, and to see what clever stuff is in there. I need to see whether it makes sense to merge, and take it from there.

        thetext: "oh boy, I still wanted to finish that one... but I keep on postponing forever and ever. \n\nIf I recall correctly, the only clever trick I used is to use different function references for different types of data, i.e. something like (in pseudo-code)\n\nif issource\n  opt.drawfnc = @drawSourceData\nelseif issensor\n  opt.drawfnc = @drawSensorData\nend\n\nand similar for other within-datatype-distinctions. Imho this made the code more readable than having an infinitely long draw function that internally dissociates different cases. If you have any more questions on what I did, feel free to bug me."

        thetext: Thanks for feedback. I started looking at the code. Can I assume that you have checked into svn the latest clever version?
