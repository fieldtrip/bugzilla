          Nietzsche discovered this because she is using a funky statfun that crashes with nans in the data (being defined on the outside voxels).

          As far as I remember, in the past ft_sourcestatistics pruned the 'dat'-matrix that went into ft_statistics_montecarlo to contain only the inside voxels.

          It could be that this feature has disappeared.
