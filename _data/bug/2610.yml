          Well, that was an easy one. ft_timelockanalysis still used keyval-syntax with ft_selectdata, and the bug was (and remains) in ft_selectdata_old.

          I now changed line 125:

            data = ft_selectdata(data, 'rpt', cfg.trials);

          to:

            tmpcfg = [];
            tmpcfg.trials = cfg.trials;
            data = ft_selectdata(tmpcfg, data);
            [cfg, data] = rollback_provenance(cfg, data);

          To be fair, I find the old syntax much easier on the eye, but I'm afraid that the new one is how it's going to be :)

          bash-4.1$ svn commit ft_timelockanalysis.m
          Sending        ft_timelockanalysis.m

          the new one provides the updated cfg, which is important for provenance. If it were a low-level function, the old one would be ok and could be extended to also provide output. But it being a high-level function imposes the end-user function call interface format with cfg as first input on it. We don't want to branch of to different functions having different user interfaces.

          Yes, sorry, I totally see the rationale for the new one and agree that it's better, my remark was just an aside.
