          below is an excerpt from an email exchange. It happens more often that people have problems with ftp, so perhaps we should also allow for http://ftp.fcdonders.nl/pub/fieldtrip. Note that this is largely to be solved by the TG.

          Sorry to hear that the problem persists. FTP is known to be problematic with firewalls. Sometimes another ftp client helps, sometimes not.  At this moment I don't have an alternative for the download from the ftp server, as it not only pertains to the (many updated versions) toolbox itself, but also the example data. The webserver that hosts fieldtrip does not have that much space to also hold the example data.

          Perhaps I can ask whether a http daemon can be installed on the ftp server as well to serve the download links.

          Since you mention that you also have a linux box, my suggestion for getting access to the code is actually to use this
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/i_would_like_an_automatic_daily_updated_version_of_the_code_can_i_get_access_to_the_cvs_or_snv_server
          It does not help for the tutorial data, but will give you all toolbox code and a means to keep it up to date. Of course with tortoiseSVN you can also use it on MS windows.

          No unfortunately, I still cannot connect to the FTP server either by Firefox
          or by Filezilla, either on my Windows computer or on a linux-Ubuntu one....
          just checked...a minute ago.
          I get an 'expired delay' error after the command LIST is ran....

        thetext: I think we can close this one, now we have moved to github. The ftp-server is still one way to get the code, but I guess that we will move more quickly towards a git-based distribution of the code.
