          Committed revision 9522.

          the following reproduces the initial problem, i.e. MATLAB hangs

          >> enginepool open 2
          >> enginecellfun(@randn, {1, 2})

          I guess there is a mutex problem

        thetext: "this issue is very old. However, I just tried to start an enginepool om 2019a on mac036, and it does not reproduce. Instead, it crashes MATLAB :-(\n\nLooking at the git commit message corresponding to SVN rev 9522, I see it is from May 2014, and it refers to MATLAB 2014a. Another recompile for maci64 was done in Dec 2014. \n\nThe a64 version for Linux was recompiled the last time in Sept 2013.\n\nIn trying to make this work on 2019a, I suggest to first try and replicate the state of affairs in 2013/2014, with the corresponding (old) MATLAB versions."
