          When I'm calling ft_topoplotER in my script the following error appears:

          ??? Error using ==> ft_topoplotER at 475
          labels in data and labels in layout do not match


          I'm trying to load an ASA-layout (file on 'ftp://ftp.fcdonders.nl/pub/incoming/': waveguard64.elc)
          Discovered that the error originates in: read_asa_elc -> reformat the electrode labels into an appropriately sized cell array goes wrong

          (check file on 'ftp://ftp.fcdonders.nl/pub/incoming/': lab.mat for the wrong and the correct output of read_asa_elc)


          If I changed it so it is working, I got the following matlab-output of ft_prepare_layout:

          creating layout from electrode file D:\...\DATA\waveguard64.elc
          creating layout for ext1020 system

          than the electrode-layout was shifted 90 degree CW to the head-layout.

        thetext: the problematic file was written with a later version of ASA than the version fieldtrip is tested with. The *.elc file contained additional information which messed up the channel labels. I have made a fix.

          Sofar I had forgotten to commit the fix. The fix is now in svn (revision 1359).
