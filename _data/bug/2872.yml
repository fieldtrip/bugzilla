          it now works for the regular files and for the raw UDP stream (without timestamps, useful with netcat debugging). File format is also auto detected.

          try this:

          hdr = ft_read_header(filename);
          dat = ft_read_data(filename);

          I just updated the documentation on http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/realtime/jinga-hi

          The description with the optional hostname and port still needs to be implemented.

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #7)

          The hostname and port arguments are now optional. Default is to start a local buffer. See help for details.
