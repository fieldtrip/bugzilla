        thetext: I am working with eep_cnt files, I ran into an error on line 629.  Should this say   for i=1:length(trg) NOT ....(tmp)?  It seems to correct the error I was having.

        thetext: "Hi Raquel,\n\nthanks for the quick report and sorry about that. Following a mail from Maarten from ANT I made a change to the code yesterday evening, but was not able to test. I committed anyway, which I should not have done.\n\nThe change had to do with cleaning up the trigger code and improving the warnings. I just fixed it, indeed like you suggested.\n\n mac001> svn commit ft_read_event.m \nSending        ft_read_event.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 8865."
