          Remeshing
          There is no precise definition, since it often varies according to the targeted goal or application. Nonetheless, it is possible to say that, given a 3D mesh, remeshing consists in computing another mesh, whose elements satisfy some quality requirements, while approximating well the input. Quality has several meanings. It can be related to the sampling, grading, regularity, size and shape of elements. Often a combination of these criteria is desired in real applications. Some remeshing techniques proceed by altering the input, and some generate a new mesh from scratch.

          I got this description from http://www.aimatshape.net/downloads/public/D1-2-1-pdf/view, where a pdf can be downloaded with an interesting glossary.
