        thetext: in public there is now hasyokogawa.m, which is for detecting the yokogawa toolbox (and the version). If possible, this should be part of ft_hastoolbox. Compare how it is done for the different spm versions.

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
