          We discussed some time ago that warning_once should check whether it has been called already during the currently executing highest-level FT function. I think, however, that an additional check on time passed might also still be useful.

          I often repeatedly execute an FT function in a loop, and now I get annoying warnings (trial definition, inaccuracy time axis, etc.) all the time.

        thetext: could you implement a test function inspect_warning_once in fieldtrip/test, with (possibly) some subfunctions that are called from the main function and that test the "once" aspect? The test function is to be called in an interactive MATLAB session to check how often the warnings happen.
