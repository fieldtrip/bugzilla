          This follows a discussion with Arno, Tim and Cyril in Aspet. The idea is to make a call to a URL to pass timestamp, version, IP, user id, etc.

          It would be important to consider protecting the privacy of the user, and it should allow for opting out.

          Arno has this in EEGLAB, linked to the plugin manager. He forwards all data to http://mixpanel.com, which has a web UI similar to google analytics.

          let me CC Hong, he might know more about this...

          Alternatives are listed on http://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-self-hosted-analytics-tools-similar-to-Mixpanel

          Perhaps we could also consider splunk.com

        thetext: Just to clarify, the service provided by pubnub.com (or pusher.com as an alternative) is a way of collecting events sent out by clients (e.g. fieldtrip functions) in realtime. It does not provide any analytical platform for display the data.

          after two small fixes in 10445 and 10446, it is now working. The regression test scripts have been triggered and I see about 600 "events", i.e. MATLAB instances having been started up.

          I just did "brew update" and got this

          ==> Homebrew has enabled anonymous aggregate user behaviour analytics
          Read the analytics documentation (and how to opt-out) here:
            https://git.io/brew-analytics

          Interesting to see how other software is handling this. We could do the same upon the first call to ft_trackusage.

          at this moment the existing usage tracker (using Mixpanel) is broken.
