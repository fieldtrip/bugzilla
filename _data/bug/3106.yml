        thetext: Lau used openMEEG for fitting a dipole to a SEF recorded with an elekta system. It worked fine with any other forward model, but not with OpenMEEG.

        thetext: I believe that the pnt -> pos name change broke some things, and my student has already fixed it but needs to navigate github to submit it. :-) we'll take care of it soon.

          I have verified that the OpenMEEG method works with my own CTF and 4D data, without any changes. @Christiano, what kind of data did it fail on for you?

          I will next try an Elekta dataset and make any necessary updates.
