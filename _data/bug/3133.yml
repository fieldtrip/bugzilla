          This follows up on repeated contacts with people that struggle with finding an efficient and good analysis strategy for steady-state and frequency-tagged data.

          I have an example dataset from Stefan Wiens (Stockholm) that I will use for this.

          We have a short example page "Use frequency analysis to estimate SSVEP amplitude" at http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/example/ssvep

          That is to be extended with the time-domain regression approach and made specific for the example dataset.

          I uploaded the dataset (BDF file) to /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp/example/ssvep
          from where it will automatically be synchronized with the fieldtrip/example/ssvep directory on the FTP server. I should also upload the trialfun, but first have to check that out in more detail.

        thetext: "(In reply to Tzvetan Popov from comment #4)\n\nThanks for the offer. The Stockholm data is indeed only visual. The experimental structure of it is didactically quite interesting with regards to analysis, as there is a ~5 s flicker, combined with 4 stimuli that are slightly jittered. So the phase of the stimuli is random relative to the flicker.\n\nOne analysis for which your SSAEP dataset would be better, is detecting the SS response on the source level (e.g. fitting two dipoles to the SSAEP, or doing a BF). \n\nLet me first write this one out, and then together look whether all cases that we want to explain are sufficiently covered."

I have a SSSSEF dataset (somatosensory steady state ;-)) which I am analyzing now and could share if needed (although the study is ongoing).\n\nIs there any further progress planned any time soon? \n\nPerhaps Robert (as well as Popov, and Stefan), it would be helpful to discuss the possible approaches with me? I know it would be for me :-)\n\nBest,\nStephen"

          The de2bi function is missing (as it is in the communications toolbox), here is a replacement

          ----------

          function b = de2bi(d, n)

          d = d(:);

          if nargin>2
            error('unsupported');
          end

          if nargin<2
            % how many bits are needed?
            n = ceil(log(max(d))/log(2));
          end

          b = zeros(numel(d), n);
          for i=1:numel(d)
            for j=1:n
              b(i,j) = bitget(d(i), j);
            end
