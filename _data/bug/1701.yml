Use the grad as input to ft_channelselection in the databrowser? Lower the ft_senstype threshold? Determine the mean-ismember in reverse, i.e. check whether each inputchan is part of the set, instead of each setmember being part of the inputchan?\n\nCC: JM, Jorn (you worked on senstype a lot no?), and Diego (suffering from the bug atm)"

          Hey Diego,

          Sorry! I've been swamped with work the past weeks and haven't gotten to it yet, my buglist is missing me :). I was planning to do a catchup session this week, but if you're in a rush today, feel free to take it.
