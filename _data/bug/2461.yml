          This is somewhat speculative and pre-emptive, but Matlab has been developing the next generation of graphics systems called handle graphics 2. Testing FT using HG2 most plots seems to initiate except the databrowser, but lots of plots error out before completion due to a simple bug caused by the following use of gcf:

          set(gcf, 'Name', sprintf('%d: %s: %s', gcf, funcname, dataname));

          gcf now returns an object which sprintf chokes on. You can use:

          cf=gcf;
          set(gcf, 'Name', sprintf('%d: %s: %s', num, funcname, dataname));

          and

          if strcmpi(class(gcf),'double')

          to check if gcf returns a HG1 (true) or HG2 (false) object.

          To run HG2 matlab use:

          > matlab -hgVersion 2 &

          A more elegant way is to cast the object to a double, works for HG1 or HG2 without issue:

          set(gcf, 'Name', sprintf('%d: %s: %s', double(gcf), funcname, dataname));

          thanks a lot, that makes life a lot easier for us. Seems like we need to add some version checking for various things, but nothing dramatic. Most crucially we need to take care to not treat figure handles as numbers anymore. And some functionality is actually finally like I would have wanted/expected it anyway (e.g. uipanel behaviour or getframe).
          Now, I need to find out whether we got some Matlab14b flying around in our institute...

          I checked the proposed fixes by the matlab report. Unfortunately, the substitutes (e.g. initiating a graphics handles as gobject instead of []) is not backwards compatible with older matlab version. Thus, we require fallback functions in case the matlab version predates 2014b.

          The most important change is indeed the change of graphic handles from being doubles to objects, thus we are not allowed to set a handle to 0 or 1 anymore. Apart from that, the report states mostly things concerning user interfaces (i.e. we need to check that they look alright, e.g. uipanels are now independent of axes and can stretch into nearby subplots). In the meanwhile, I will fix the 'Name' issue now by casting gcf to a double, which Ian reported to be compatible.

          FYI, matlab2014b just arrived at the Donders. I installed it on my local (mac) machine, and soon we'll also get it on windows and linux.

          at startup, it states: "MATLAB R2014b introduces a new MATLAB graphics system. New default colors, fonts, and styles make your data easier to interpret. ... Some existing graphics-related code may need to be revised to work in R2014b."

          looking forward to revising FT plotting functions :-(

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #10)

          I noticed test_bug2096 failing due to ft_sourceplot/ft_plot_ortho dealing with handles as numbers, whereas in matlab2014a they are objects.

          This is a partial fix, there is more to be done.

          Thanks for reporting the specific bug.

          There have been significant changes in the graphics in matlab2014b, which we are aware of. It will take time to resolve these issues. I hope that you can revert to matlab2014a for the time being.

          We addressed this issue in our bug binge. Various people have been testing different sections of the code, with a focus on whether there is an error (i.e. crash in the code)

          It seems that most functions now do not result in errors any more. However, the interaction (selection of electrodes and time/frequency/channel windows) is not fully working yet. So we cannot close the bug yet.

          btw, sure that the interactive selection does not work? I thought I fixed that when fixing ft_select_range. I quickly checked with some TFR data and it works fine. Not sure about source data/plotting though.
          I will work with 2014b from now on to see if there are more issues popping up. Maybe others can do the same and report back in detail on what is still not functioning.

        thetext: fixed a small bug related to using colormap('default') in ft_sourceplot. With all other colormaps you can assign colormap(COLORMAP) to a variable, but not when COLORMAP is 'default'. I changed it so that first the colormap is updated and then the current colormap is assigned to a variable.

          we should remind ourselves to update the guidelines with all the decisions we made during the bug binge!

          the problem with cfg.artfctdef.zvalue.interactive has been resolved as part of bug 2857.
