Note that MATLAB does not need to be installed on this acquisition computer as acq2ftx is written in C-code. The buffer is available to any other PC via TCP/IP.\n\nB) Another dedicated computer, termed the realtime pc, which gets the headposition data from the FieldTrip buffer and does the plotting (using ft_realtime_headlocalizer from matlab command window). Note that the latter can also be done on the acquisition computer, but we chose to split the two processes over two computers (acquisition and visualization).\n\nThe steps involved:\n1) install fieldtrip on the CTF acquisition computer (and on the realtime pc)\n2) run from linux terminal: /fieldtrip/realtime/src/acquisition/ctf/acq2ftx\n3) start acq\n4) start matlab and make sure this directory is added to path: /fieldtrip/realtime/online_meg\n5) cfg.dataset = 'buffer://localhost:1972' (this address should point to the location where the buffer is run - i.e. the acquisition computer)\n   ft_realtime_headlocalizer(cfg)"

In Nijmegen that also does not work, because the RH version is too old\n\nroboos@odin> cat /etc/redhat-release \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux WS release 3 (Taroon Update 4)\n\nConsequently, any recent version of MATLAB won't run due to all sorts of library issues.\n\nIt is enough to run acq2ftx on the acquisition computer and MATLAB on another computer. In our case the acquisition computer is called odin, and we use it as\n\ncfg.dataset = 'buffer://odin:1972'\n\nfor the ft_realtime examples."

          I'll have a look at it together with Michael next week Tuesday. I think we will first try to get the realtime headlocalizer running, the spatial filter business can follow later. We'll keep you posted.

          I suggest you start with the ft_realtime_signalviewer, that is the most simple one.

          Michal asked

          thanks for the help. My question initially was whether the CTF virtual
          channels that you can add to your recording (and see in 'realtime aliong
          with the other channels in data monitor), count as recorded channels,
          and could be written to the buffer.

          I actually don't know. I do not see a reson why not, because the data seems to be made available by Acq very late in it's pipeline. Could you try it out and let us know?

          Sounds like that should work. Fascinating if it would.
