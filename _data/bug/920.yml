          I was mistaken: walltime can actually be just in seconds. The issue was with the specification of memory requirements in the same string:

          -l walltime=300:mem=400000

          will be interpreted by qsub as an invalid walltime string, rather than as a valid walltime (i.e., in seconds) and a valid memory requirement string.

          The following works, however:

          -l walltime=300 -l mem=400000

          I made the appropriate change, and deleted qsub/private/formattim.m.
