          In fieldtrip/plotting there is a plot_topo.m and also an ft_plot_topo. The latter one was added by crimic to add some functionality according to the SVN log:

          manages the case of mask internal to channels' boundaries
          A  + ft_plot_topo.m
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          whereas of course the functionality should have been added to the existing function. Please merge the functionality and remove ft_plot_topo.

          it was also needed to add plotting/compat to the users path, otherwise the high-level functions (which still call plot_topo etc.) would not work.

          I have added plotting/.compat to the path-handling in fieldtripdefs
