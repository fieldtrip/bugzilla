          at the natmeg I found out that the triggers were sent as separate bits, but (coinciding in time) were represented after ft_read_event as a single value (i.e. bit 1 plus bit 2 represents value 3).

          It should be possible to choose between a combined value and separate bits, at least for neuromag fif files, but perhaps also for others.
