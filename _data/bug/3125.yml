          I encounter the following problem:

          I want to align electrodes (standard10_05.elc) autmoatically based on fiducials to an individual head but what ft_electroderealign does is bring it further away (it says so in it's own output (line 467  fprintf('mean distance between fiducials prior to realignment %f, after realignment %f\n', dpre, dpost);)

          I have made the warps manually and figured out that line 452 (norm.m       = elec2common / templ2common;) is the problem in my case. If I use ft_warp_apply sequentially first with elec2common and then with inv(templ2common) it works well and the results are correct.
          But this way the electrodes are tilted into the wrong direction.

          (In reply to Daniel Miklody from comment #4)

          thanks for the test data, I can reproduce the problem. The input specification is fine. And furthermore thanks for locating the problem and fixing it. The forward and back slash as matrix operations are always tricky.

          I just made a number of commits that solve the issue. While at it, I also reorganised some internal code. Furthermore, I added the 'project' method (which was planned anyway).

          Since your electrodes are very loose around the head after realigning, you should give method=project a try. See fieldtrip/test/inspect_bug3125 as example, which is based on your data (I keep it for reference and future testing).

          Alrighty!

          Good to be helpful ;)

          Thanks also for adding the project method, I was already using it but good to have it in a standard interafece fashion!!
