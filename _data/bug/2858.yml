          Hi everyone,

          I´m trying to do the grand average of two source files, but I receive the following error:

          the input sources vary in the field pos

          I´m pretty sure I assigned the same .pos structure to both files from a template grid, I checked and they are identical. Below is the code, and the link for the cell array with the two source structures and the template grid is here:

          https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3ckvvwommnsznl7/AABHeddj6Nv4hmV0g03RTRI6a?dl=0

          cfg                 = [];
          cfg.keepindividual  = 'no';
          for ifq             = 1%:numel(freq)
             for icontr       = 1%:numel(contrast_name)
                grandsource   = ft_sourcegrandaverage(cfg,grand{:,ifq,icontr});
             end
          end

          Thanks!
          Rodolfo

          I have downloaded the data to /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/bug2858 and can confirm the problem. Inside ft_sourcegrandaverage after ft_checkdata the grid positions somehow seem to have changed from the regular (integer) values to the warped-to-individual slightly irregular values. The latter are (of course) different between the subjects.

          But it remains a mystery sofa where and why the conversions happens.

The source.avg.pos positions are the individualised ones, whereas source.pos is the regular grid in MNI space.\n\nNow the question is: how did source.avg.pos get there in the first place? FieldTrip should not put it there, but recent changes to the handing of source data may have caused this to happen for a short window of time. \n\nRight now I cannot reproduce ft_sourceanalysis resulting in source.avg.pos any more, so to me it seems that it has been resolved already.\n\nI recommend you rerun your source analysis, or that you remove source.avg.pos from your existing data structures."
