          Hmmm, that is odd (works for me). The subfunction browse_movieplotER opens a figure window with zbuffer as a renderer, which is what I guess fails on a/your windows machine.
          Zbuffer should work for both platforms I guess though. I usually use zbuffer because my machines have to many opengl issues, but I don't see a reason why this is the default for browse_movieplot. Maybe it has to do something with speed of movie-plotting. Jorn, as our movieplot expert, any thoughts on this?

          jim knows how this is caused.

          proposed solution, something like:

          if ispc
           wait 100ms
           continue with further plot opening
          end

          It turns out that the wrong function was called on Windows. Selecting movieplotER from the context-menu should call private/browse_movieplotER (which is a wrapper that creates a new figure and calls ft_movieplotER). However, in my case it was calling compat/movieplotER (a compatibility wrapper which does not create a new window).

          The problem was the following line in 'iscompatwrapper':

          "b = strcmp(x(1:end-numel(funcname)-2), [ftPath 'compat/']);"

          Obviously the file seperator "/" is used which is wrong on windows pc's. This prevented ft_getuserfun from seeing that compat/movieplotER was a compatibility wrapper and ft_databrowser therefore called the wrong function. I will change the line of code to:

          "b = strcmp(x(1:end-numel(funcname)-2), [ftPath 'compat' filesep]);"
