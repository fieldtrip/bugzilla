        thetext: "When I run fieldtrip2fiff, I get this error:\n\n??? Undefined function or variable 'fsample'.\n\nError in ==> fieldtrip2fiff at 61\n  info.sfreq = fsample;\n\nThis is because fsample hasn't been defined before, but not that info.sfreq contains the sampling frequency and it seems there is no need to be set.\n\nI commented info.sfreq = fsample in line 61, I get this error:\n\n??? Undefined variable dataout.\n\nError in ==> fieldtrip2fiff at 62\n  if info.nchan ~= size(dataout{1},1);\n\nThis is because dataout hasn't been defiend in the code. Again I commented that 'if' in line 62. It seems OK, and I can read it with other softwares like spm, but the problem is that I cannot read the file with fieldtrip any more. \n\nThe 'data' I used here was continuous and not epoched data."

          Hi Hamid,

          Can you please check that the solution to bug 2036 not already solves it?

          (In reply to comment #1)

          Yes, it is duplicate of that, but note that I updated svn today and got these erros. Please also make sure you can read the converted fiff files again using fieldtrip

          Thanks
