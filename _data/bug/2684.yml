        thetext: "As I've commented in bug2685, where should we best start increasing support of combined MEG-EEG datasets? \n\nIn the case of the Stockholm workshop we are splitting the data early on into an EEG and a MEG part using ft_preprocessing and cfg.channel = 'EEG' / 'MEG'. (Un-)fortunately traces of the other data remain, such as the grad field when using cfg.channel = 'EEG'. Certain functions, such as ft_scalpcurrentdensity, are only meant to be used on EEG data and will block when they detect presence of MEG data (e.g. a grad field).\n\nShould we allow these functions to process data containing traces of the unsupported data and throw a warning instead? The user is after all responsible for supplying the correct data. Or should we make sure that traces of the other data are completely removed when splitting the data?"

          So far then we have ft_scalcurrentdensity and ft_prepare_neighbours crash on EEG data with a grad field.

          For the workshop hands-on I am adding a rmfield, and not it as a bug.

          it works when using cfg.senstype = 'EEG';

          Fortunately the error is clear in what you have to do to solve the problem. ft_scalpcurrentdensity should not fail anymore because senstype is always set to 'EEG' as it is not supposed to be run on MEG data. It could be that the version you are using is slightly outdated.
