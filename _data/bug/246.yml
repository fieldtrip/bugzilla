        thetext: there is a hook to the svn software that should do this. I guess that the twitter API has changed, which means that the hook has to be updated. It requires login on the svn server and sudo root to change stuff in /home/svn/fieldtrip or so.

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
