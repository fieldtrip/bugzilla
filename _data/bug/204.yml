        thetext: this happens when a trial returns an empty spectrum in the case of mtmconvol, which happens when the data is shorter than the timewindow requested. JM will fix this.

        thetext: Hmmm, doesn't this mean that all frequencies/timepoints will only have NaNs (because of equal padding across trials)? Leading to a faulty output in all cases? If I'm right, it might be easiest to throw an error if all(~isnan)==1, instead of building a fix around it. Or was this what you were thinking about?

        thetext: |-
          the spectrum returned in such case actually contains only nans, which originally resulted in problems when the matrix containing non-nan numeric data was reshaped, i.e. the reshape operation failed. this has now been fixed by explicitly allocating the variables related to the new size in a different way.
          moreover, along the way it turned out that the nan-allocation for the output data (mtmconvol when no estimate can be made for a particular voxel) was incorrect in the case of keeptrials and keeptapers. this has also been resolved, I think.
