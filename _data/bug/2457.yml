          because it's just shitty code, I guess ;-).

          Uhm, I think that ft_checkconfig tries to make a sub-structure out of the options that are needed for the lower level ft_connectivity_pdc. Could be that it's just a typo in the comment.

          No, not a typo in the comment. Ft_connectivityanalysis is calling ft_checkconfig when the inparam (i.e. the parameter from the data to use as input to the lower level function) is equal to transfer. This is the case both for granger and pdc. Apparently, the writer of the code only thought it necessary to create a sub-structure for 'granger' in that case.
          The question now is, whether the user is right, or the writer of the code ;-).
          Don't know whether any sub-cfg-options are used to begin with in ft_connectivity_pdc.

          I suspect that the cfg.granger.channelcmb is needed for multiple pairwise. Don't know whether multiple pairwise spectral factorization should be supported by PDC, because this is inherently advertised as a 'multivariate' measure, i.e. it allegedly quantifies directed coherence between a and b with the rest of the signals partialed out.

        thetext: I am not sure whether this is still an issue. I think it's fixed.
