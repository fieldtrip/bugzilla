          hi Robert,

          I am looking at the ft_electroderealign function, and indeed it seems it aligns chanpos instead of elecpos.
          But when a template set of electrodes is used for alignment it makes sens to align chanpos, because the base of the alignment are those electrodes which have the same label in the template and in the to-be-aligned electrode set.
          And we discussed yesterday that chanpos has label and not elecpos.

          So, I think the alignment makes sens only if the chanpos and elecpos are the same at those electrodes which are used for alignment. (Or at least there should be minimum one such electrode/channel).

          So, I could ensure in the script:
          - the to-be-aligned electrodes and the template have elecpos and chanpos fields
          - the to-be-aligned electrodes and the template have common labels
          - it is true at least for one the channels with the common labels that elec.elecpos(x) = elec.chanpos(x) in the to-be-aligned electrodes (or alternatively: all electrodes with common labels should have the same elecpos and chanpos)

          Is it OK?

I most cases however, there will NOT be a complicated re-referencing scheme and chanpos==elecpos, nchan=nelec and tra=eye(nchan,nelec).\n\nft_electroderealign predates the change of the sens structure to explicitly haev chanpos+elecpos. The layout of the whitespace code suggests that there has been a simple search-and-replace to the code, not taking elecpos into account. \n\nI suggest to change the code according to\n1) determine a Nx3 elecpos and a Nx1 label array. Keep these separate from the elec structure. \n2) determine the transformation for that elecpos\n3) use ft_transform_sens to apply the transformation on the elec structure."

          Not SPM. I have a tool in MEEGtools that uses ft_interactiverealign but it was mainly used for our DBS-MEG stuff. I don't think anyone else uses it.

          I forgot that we also have ft_interactiverealign. So FT has three functions with a similar purpose...

          And I put also into the reference documentation that the input electrode definition should contain the same elecpos and chanpos fields.
