          ft_statistics_stats now only outputs t-values when doing a two-samples t-test. Til asked if we could have the function produce t-statistics also in case other t-tests are used.

          I will update the function accordingly. Perhaps we can also have the other statistical tests called by this function output their test statistics (e.g. kruskalwallis)

          I think the reason for it being limited as it is, is that other statistics may output multiple fields which are not al easily reshaped into a consistent representation. But where possible, I fully agree in increasing the output of the function.

          Please pay attention to using the correct dimord.

          Where possible I've allowed ft_statistics_stat to output the test statistic value. I've also removed some instances where the variable ci was preallocated but not used.
