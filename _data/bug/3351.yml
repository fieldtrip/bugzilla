          Guido Nolte's code for eLoreta (inverse/private/mkfilt_eloreta_v2.m). The main ones are:

          * The matrix M in line 52 is calculated using the inverse instead of the pseudo-inverse. Pascual-Marqui states in arXiv 0710.3341 equation 44 that the pseudo-inverse should be used here.

          * The exit condition of the iterative method in line 62 compares the matrix W with the matrix one iteration before. However, as the old W matrix is updated every dipole calculation, the matrix is comparing almost with itself (except for the last dipole). The update of Wold should be taken out of the loop.

        thetext: "This code has been taken from Guido, I suggest you discuss with him these implementation details.\n\nWith respect to your first point: the inversion is done on a regularized matrix, which is very similar to taking the moore-penrose pseudoinverse, so no problem here, I'd say.\n\nWith respect to your second point: you might be right.\n\nPlease suggest a fix by means of a PR on github. \n\nSee www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/git for instructions"
