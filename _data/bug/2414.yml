        thetext: "## System:\nSystem Locale: en_CA.UTF-8\nSystem: Linux 3.8_amd64\nMatlab: 8.2.0.701 (R2013b)\n\nUsing either:\nJava: version \"1.7.0_25\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.3.10)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)\n\nor:\nJava version \"1.7.0_45\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)\n\n\n## Problem:\nWhen I use `ft_read_neuralynx_interp()`, I get the following error:\n\n> Invalid field name: 'DspFilterDelay_µ'.\n>\n> Error in setfield (line 34)\n>     s.(deblank(strField)) = varargin{end};\n>\n> Error in neuralynx_getheader (line 76)\n>       hdr = setfield(hdr, key, val);\n>\n> Error in read_neuralynx_ncs (line 37)\n> hdr = neuralynx_getheader(filename);\n>\n> Error in ft_read_header (line 1196)\n>     ncs = read_neuralynx_ncs(filename, 1, 0);\n>\n> Error in ft_read_neuralynx_interp (line 32)\n>   orig(i) = ft_read_header(fname{i});\n\n\nIt turns out that Matlab is trying to set a keyname in a struct based on\ninput from the neuralynx data headers, and one of those names is\n`DspFilterDelay_µ`. For some reason, my instance of matlab is happy with\nunicode characters pasted into the console or editor, and I can set\nstrings containing unicode characters, but I can't use unicode in identifiers:\n\n>>> '?'\n> ans =\n> ?\n\nworks fine, while the following fails:\n\n>>> ? = 1\n>  ? = 1\n>  |\n> Error: The input character is not valid in MATLAB statements or expressions.\n\n## Solution:\nI replaced the line:\n\n      hdr = setfield(hdr, key, val);\n\nin `neuralynx_getheader.m` with these lines:\n\n      try\n        hdr = setfield(hdr, key, val);\n      catch\n        fprintf('Key contains unallowed characters: %s, stripping...',key);\n        key = regexprep(key,'[^a-zA-Z]','');\n        hdr = setfield(hdr, key, val);\n      end \n\nThis solves the problem on my system, but won't result in any changes on systems supporting fully unicode characters.\n\nRegards,\nJason Locklin, \nUniversity of Waterloo, Canada"

        thetext: hi Robert, neuralynx_getheader shows a crash for the newer system because of unicode chars in the header. Do you agree with the proposed solution?

          The original fix here was not correct - as it was char(181) causing problems. I put the right comparison with char(181) in there now.
          Jason's solution would work as well although numbers would have to be added. But it would leave us blind to the information being removed - therefore I'd prefer to solve one by one.
