          TO DO:
          -check whether any code is using this info
          -if not, remove it.
          -if yes, check whether this code can be made independent of this.
          -do the above.
          -and then remove it.

          I'm currently working on ft_sourcedescriptives.

          Where would ft_sourcedescriptives get the method information if the field is removed (which is done by ft_datatype_source).

        thetext: "I think that the 'method' field was mainly intended to make a distinction between the different single ways data could be represented in the 'trial' field.\n\nOnce upon a time (and it may even still work) one could do a jackknife single trial type of source reconstruction, where each of the output 'trials' was a beamformer reconstruction, based on the covariance/csd matrix of all trials minus one. Also, a bootstrap or permutation based reshuffling of trials was possible, each of which giving a different 'method'. \n\nI am not sure whether we would still actively want to support these options. I see the benefit of making a clean implementation of ft_sourcedescriptives, where data is passed through ft_datatype_source. I guess we should decide whether the method field is passed on by this function, or whether we would allow for looking in the provenance (source.cfg.previous. ... . previous etc) to determine the 'method'. \n\nAdding Robert to CC to put it on his radar, so that he could join the discussion"
