          Created attachment 481
          data to reproduce bug

          Which crashes stuff like freqstatistics etc.

          To reproduce, load data in attachment and:

          x = ft_appendfreq([], s, s)

          Diego, could this be due to one of your changes?

          Yes, sorry, the cfg.parameter should have been there of course.

          I simply reverted ft_appendfreq to an earlier revision, so I don't have any trouble. (But that solution of course won't work for people working with the /home/common/-release)

          Of course it should remain possible for people to do
            ft_freqstatistics(cfg, dataset{:});
          instead of having to call freqgrandaverage first.

          Fine with me
          I went back to the before-fix ft_appendfreq version but I cannot commit it

          svn up -r 8144 ft_appendfreq.m

          Do you know a way to updated commit the 8144 revision to have it at the home/common folder? I can copy-paste but I'd like to know if there's a more elegant workaround

           Hi Eelke,

          I made a minor change in ft_appendfreq and I created test fucntion +data and updated the test_ft_appendfreq and no errors so far:


          Sending        ft_appendfreq.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 8187.


          Adding         test_bug1984_2187.m
          Adding  (bin)  test_bug1984_2187.mat
          Sending        test_ft_appendfreq.m
          Transmitting file data ...
          Committed revision 8188.

          Could you please try to test the code with your data? then I can continue adding the grad, chamcmb and other fields
