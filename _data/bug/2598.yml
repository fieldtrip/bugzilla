        thetext: "this is due to mxSerialize/mxDeserialize not being available for 2014a. See bug 2452.\n\nAll mex files that call these low-level functions need to be recompiled on 2014a. The consequence is also that different mex files are needed for matlab <=Â 2013b and >= 2014a on the same computer. \n\nI suggest you look into the solution used in 2452 and coy that into the peer mex file."

        thetext: "Hi Robert,\n\nI get the same error, using R2015a (OS X 10.11) and any of the peer functions. I've read through bug 2452 which tells me the error shouldn't occur anymore. \n\nI've tried placing all mxDeserialize files (in trunk/private) into trunk/peer/private, but peer doesn't seem to use them?\n\nThe function msSerialize is present and works fine. \n\nWhen I go to trunk/private, and run mxDeserialize however, I get:\n >> mxDeserialize('hmmm')\nError using mxDeserialize_cpp\nBad version or endian-key\n\nError in mxDeserialize (line 35)\n  argout = mxDeserialize_cpp(argin);\n\nIf there's anything I can do, I'd be happy too"

        thetext: Previously, I switched to an older version of matlab, but have now returned to this issue. It seems that the code of peer.c needs to be changed such that the cpp files for Mx[De]Serialize are called in the cpp fashion. It may be that peer.c needs to be updated to cpp, but I'm really not sure, as my capacities here are limited. I was wondering if anybody has found a fix.
