        thetext: "Compilation of the peer mex file initially failed because of inet_ntop (used for determining the IP address from the peer multicast packet) is missing. \n\nI have implemented a workaround in discover.c, which works by setting ipaddr to all zeros, and in peer.c and peerslave.c in detecting whether it has length zero. If ipaddr is empty, it now uses teh hostname (which goes through nslookup).\n\nIdeally, for the different compilers on windows a consistent solution for inet_ntop should be implemented."
