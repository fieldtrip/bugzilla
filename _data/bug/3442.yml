        thetext: "Hi,\n\nWe are doing source reconstruction, and for the forward modelling we use a SimBio FEM-model with the recommended pipeline from Vorwerk et al 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-018-0463-y). The problem is that in our pipeline we successively call ft_prepare_vol_sens,  ft_prepare_headmodel, ft_prepare_leadfield and ft_sourceanalysis. The latter two of these functions calls prepare_headmodel (not the same as ft_prepare_headmodel!), which in line 112 again calls ft_prepare_vol_sens. So in summary, we end up calling ft_prepare_vol_sens three times in our pipeline, which is problematic, because ft_prepare_vol_sens is very slow for our FEM model. \n\nSo far, our fix is to change prepare_headmodel to implement a test to see if it is necessary to run ft_prepare_vol_sens again, as follows (ft_prepare_vol_sens populates the headmodel.transfer field by calling sb_transfer):\n\nif ~isfield(headmodel,'transfer') \n    [headmodel, sens] = ft_prepare_vol_sens(headmodel, sens, 'channel', cfg.channel, 'order', cfg.order);\nend\n\nEven though this problem is probably less significant for other types of models, because ft_prepare_vol_sens might be quicker, I still think the problem should be fixed.\n\nBest regards,\nArnfinn Aamodt"

          Sorry for not catching up on this, but would the following address the issue?

          https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/517

          If so, I think that this can be closed, right?
