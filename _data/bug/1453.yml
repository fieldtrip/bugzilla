          A long, long time ago (in December), I talked with Robert about this. He explained the rationale behind the FT buffer, and suggested that it should be possible to read header information without all chunks, which would e.g. speed up the case where you are just interested in knowing how many samples have been already written.
          This is on my to-do list for a long time already, but I didn't have time to work on this, unfortunately...

          As a sidenote:
          Retrieving the # of samples can be more easily done using the buffer.c file rather than using ft_read_header. So, I am not sure how much prority this function does have then
