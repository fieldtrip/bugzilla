        thetext: "Created attachment 257\ncontains variables tmp and freqm0 described in text above for duplicating error\n\nI erroneously thought I could calculate the coherence between two single time courses w/o repetitions, on data with size 1 for the dimension rpttap.  If rpttap has size 1, a general error is returned as described below.   A mat file containing the variables described in the post is attached. The following correspondence summarizes the bug. \n\n--->CUT: from my listserve posting<-----\nWhy do I get an error when my fourierspctrm with dimord\nrpttap_chan_freq has dimensions of 1 x 128 x 10 (the key being, just 1\nrpttap value for each channel x frequency combination)?\n\nAt each channel & frequency, fourierspctrum contains a complex value\nso the data structure contains the phase and amplitude information at\neach channel and frequency, which I think -- perhaps incorrectly --\nshould be sufficient to calculate the coherence.\n\nI'll paste below an example of the error I'm getting, beginning with\nthe initial data structure through the ft_connectivityanalysis error.\nIF the initial data structure (called tmp in this example) has rpt\nsize > 1, then I don't get the error.\n\nThanks,\nClara\n\ntmp =\n\n        label: {128x1 cell}\n         time: [0.3380 0.3400 0.3420 0.3440 0.3460 0.3480 0.3500\n0.3520 0.3540 0.3560 0.3580 0.3600 0.3620 0.3640 0.3660 0.3680 0.3700\n0.3720]\n          cfg: [1x1 struct]\n        trial: [1x128x18 double]\n   sampleinfo: [1 18]\n       dimord: 'rpt_chan_time'\n\ncfg=[];\ncfg.output='fourier';\ncfg.method='mtmfft';\ncfg.tapsmofrq=28;\ncfg.channel={'all'};\n\nfreqm0=ft_freqanalysis(cfg, tmp)\n\nthe input is timelock data with 128 channels and 18 timebins\nprocessing trials\nWarning: using only one taper for specified smoothing\nIn specest/private/warning_once at 75\n In ft_specest_mtmfft at 96\n In ft_freqanalysis at 519\nprocessing trial 1/1 nfft: 18 samples, datalength: 18 samples, 1 tapers\nthe call to \"ft_freqanalysis\" took 0 seconds and an estimated 0 MB\n\nfreqm0 =\n\n           label: {128x1 cell}\n          dimord: 'rpttap_chan_freq'\n            freq: [0 27.7778 55.5556 83.3333 111.1111 138.8889\n166.6667 194.4444 222.2222 250.0000]\n   fourierspctrm: [1x128x10 double]\n       cumsumcnt: 18\n       cumtapcnt: 1\n             cfg: [1x1 struct]\n\ncfg=[];\ncfg.method='coh';\ncfg.channelcmb={'E34', 'E98'};\n   fdm0=ft_connectivityanalysis(cfg, freqm0)\nselection fourierspctrm along dimension 2\n\n???

Could you create yourself an account on our bugzilla-website (bugzilla.fcdonders.nl) and file a 'bug' for this issue? It would be really helpful if you paste the information below and upload a small datafile containing the variables (i.e. freq structure) enabling us to locally reproduce the issue. We will then try and address this issue as soon as possible."
