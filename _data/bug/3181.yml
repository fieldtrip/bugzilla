        thetext: It is somewhat annoying if the optodetemplate.xml, which is needed for reading in Artinis oxy3 files, is not in the Matlab path, because the read-in pluging opens a dialog asking for the location of this file for each trial. An option to circumvent is to make the respective variable persistent and store the location of the optodetemplate.xml. In addition, a cfg-option could be added in case the user wants to specify an optodetemplate.xml at another specific location.

          I just encountered this. I had to locate it with the GUI for some 10 times or so.

          If I move it to a location on my path, it does not ask. It would also be nice that if it were present at the location of the oxy3 file, that it would be read from there.

          One mechanism already in place: ft_preprocessing will call ft_read_header once, and the hdr is then passed on to all subsequent calls of ft_read_data, so that it does not have to be re-read. We might want to check that ft_databrowser does this as well.
