It would be better to make it concrete by demonstrating with real data and proper MATLAB code how the scaling is done. \n\nThe function ft_transform_vol can be used to scale the volume conduction model. The function ft_electroderealign can be used to position the electrodes on the model. \n\nWe need a file with 3D electrode locations (in mm), and a matching file with 2D locations for visualisation. To properly document this we also need a volume conduction model (can be a first rough model)."

          Going along the analysis script in detail, it turns out that this is a recurring issue:

          1) dealing with different atlas sizes: there is brain atlas and paxinos-franklin. Are they the same size (in mm)? They are certainly not expressed in the same coordinate system.

          2) dealing with different size between atlas and actual animal: We use the brainatlas MRI (which comes with a segmented version) to make the volume conduction model. What if the actual animal is not the same size as the animal depicted in brainatlas?

          3) dealing with electrodes in the 2D layout: the electrodes are represented in a layout together with an outline of the animal head. The electrodes have a fixed arrangement. How to deal with the layout in case the animal is of a different size?

          4) dealing with electrode in the 3D volume conduction model: again the electrodes have a fixed arrangement. The actual animal might have a different size. The placement of the electrodes on the brainatlas head model might not match the placement on the actual animal.

          5) dealing with the mapping of source reconstruction results on the actual animal, and dealing with the mapping of source reconstruction results on the atlas: how to map between actual animal, volume model and atlas space?

        thetext: What is the status of this? Will it be finalized soon? If not, I suggest to close it for now, because there will probably nobody else who feels strongly enough about this to bring it to a good end.
