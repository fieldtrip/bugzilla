          Please attach "test_ft_preprocessing.m" here. I work presently to fix
          Yokogawa stuff.

          Hi Till,

          The idea would be that upon the call to ft_read_header, where the gradiometer description is created by reading in the file's header info, the description of the gradiometer array is according to the new convention. See: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_are_electrodes_magnetometers_or_gradiometers_described

          At present, the low-level reading functions still represent the gradiometer array in the old-fashioned way, and rely on fixsens and channelposition (both private functions) to convert this representation. My suggestion would be to avoid this altogether, and represent the hdr.grad correct to begin with. This should be done in yokogawa2grad. Furthermore, in order to support backward compatibility, i.e. allowing to use data which is already on disk, we could consider writing a separate 'elsif' clause in channelposition for the yokogawa system.

          Hi Jan-Mathijs,

          I will change yokogawa2grad to reflect the new convention.

          I do not understand your remark
          "In order to support backward
          compatibility, we could
          consider writing a separate 'elsif' clause in channelposition for the yokogawa
          system."

          Where exactly in channelposition is this 'elseif' needed ?

          Yours, Till

          Dear Till,

          For the ctf-system we use the convention that the chanpos is the location of the bottom coil, i.e. the coil closest to the head. Same goes for the chanori. Indeed for magnetometers the chanpos and chanori are the same as the corresponding coilpos and coilori.

          I paste an e-mail from Robert here relating to this bug.
          So bug can be closed.

          ****

          Hi Till,

          This should now be fixed twofold:
          - channelposition now already work fine with with mixed gradiometers and magnetometers
          - the grad does not contain the refs any more, i.e. it only consists of gradiometers
