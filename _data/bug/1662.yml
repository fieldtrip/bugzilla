          on http://www.sci.utah.edu/cgi-bin/NCRRdatasets.pl?schterm1=scirun&schfield1=keywords there is a brain example.

          The data is here
          http://www.sci.utah.edu/datasets/NCRRarchive/brain-eg/brain-eg.tgz

          The meta information lists

          Description:
          Comprehensive dataset of a head. This dataset contains a segmented tetrahedral finite element mesh, high- and low-resolution surface models of the scalp and cortex, a point-cloud of electrodes, and a dipole location for a forward simulation.
          Conductivities:
          0 / air / 0.0
          1 / skin / 1.0
          2 / bone / 0.05
          3 / csf / 4.62
          4 / gray-matter / 1.0
          5 / white-matter / 0.43
          Number of nodes: 70214
          Number of cells: 396285
          Bounding box: [-109.909, -85.0187, -1032.51] -- [26.923, 133.483, -834.712]
          The spatial units for the BrainEG head model are millimeters. The conductivity units are (Siemens / meter) x 1.0E1.

          This should all be sufficiently detailed to be able to import the mesh and do something with it. It would be a nice test case  for the FEM EEG solver in FieldTrip.

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
