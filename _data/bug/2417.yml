        thetext: "Created attachment 572\nThe script in which the problem is highlighted\n\nI encountered this problem using the matlab function butter.m, but it is probably not restricted to this function alone.\n\nThe input of the upper cut-off frequency should be smaller than 1 (not equal). Now there seems to be a slight change in numerical precision when a job is executed by means of qsubfeval: where feval (or cellfun) run normally, qsubfeval (or qsubcellfun) crash in the same computation. Qsub gives the error that the input is equal to or larger than 1.\n\nAttached a script that highlights the problem, including the output it gives when I run it. \n\nI stopped the script in debug mode at line 415 \"[status, result] = system(cmdline);\" of qsubfeval. At this point executing \"qsubexec(jobid);\" (line 421) works fine, though executing line 415 gives the above error message.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nTim van Mourik"

          the cluster is too busy right now to try different types of machines.
