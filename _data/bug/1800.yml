          hey dude... ehm, strange bug. I checked the layout and channelposition, but that's alright, I checked channelselection, that's alright either. then as a sanity check I also checked whether just one of your samples is crazy and blowing things up, but that's not it also. Plotting from 2:end is fine and plotting from 1:end-1 is also fine. Gonna think about what might be going wrong, atm I'm pretty much stepping in the dark here

        thetext: "Created attachment 359\nfirst and second half of giorgos data  - they cancel out\n\nHey Giorgos,\n\nI present: \"demystifying your data\"\nLet me start off with my guess: Nothing is wrong with FieldTrip. Your data is just noise ;)\nLet me explain: I attached a figure in which I use a low-level matlab function that is indeed used by FieldTrip to plot your data. I essence it's a topographic map of your data, just without the fancy head shape, nose and ears. I plotted the first half of your datasamples and the last half of your data. It's pretty easy to spot that they are the more-or-less exact reverse from one another. Thus, if leaving out only one sample from either half, you end up with basically plotting the inverse of this one sample. If you plot all your data, all your samples exactly cancel out and you are left with some measurement noise. \n\nHere's the steps I did to get there:\n1) put a break point in ft_topoplotTFR at line 694.\n\n2) Define the first and second half of your experiment:\n    dat    = data.(cfg.parameter);\n    dat_half_1 = nanmean(dat(:, 1:993), 2); % you got 1987 samples\n    dat_half_2 = nanmean(dat(:, 994:1987), 2);\n\n3) plot contours:\n  hlim = [min(chanX) max(chanX)];\n  vlim = [min(chanY) max(chanY)];\n\n  xi         = linspace(hlim(1), hlim(2), 67);       \n  yi         = linspace(vlim(1), vlim(2), 67);      \n  figure;\n  subplot(211)\n  [Xi,Yi,Zi] = griddata(chanX', chanY, dat_half_1, xi', yi, 'nearest');\n  contourf(Xi,Yi,Zi);\n  subplot(212)\n  [Xi,Yi,Zi] = griddata(chanX', chanY, dat_half_2, xi', yi, 'nearest');\n  contourf(Xi,Yi,Zi);\n\nSo, after analyzing your data for you, co-author on paper? :P\n\ntbh: pretty unlikely that data cancels out exactly, so I guess you are doing some crazy step in your analysis pipeline? The funny thing is, it does not matter at all *where* I split the data into two parts. Even if I do:\n    dat_half_1 = nanmean(dat(:, 1), 2);\n    dat_half_2 = nanmean(dat(:, 2:1987), 2);\nthey are the reverse of each other. \n\nSince I did not use any FieldTrip here in this code (apart from determining the layout, but that's fine), it cannot be a FieldTrip error."
