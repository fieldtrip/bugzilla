      thetext: "I noticed while working on bug #2185 that there is a discrepancy of what code is located where. The fixXXX stuff is still scattered, which is especially annoying for moving forward with the new source representation.\n\nI suggest to move all functionality from the sub function fixsource in ft_checkdata to the ft_datatype_source function. \n\nI also noticed that dimord is listed as required field in ft_datatype_source, although not a single function will presently fail if it is absent. So it does not seem to be strongly required, but rather optional. Note that in converting old to new style, it will be difficult to assign a single dominant dimord, but easy to assign the specific powdimord etc.\n\nSee test_bug2185 for some code to get started. \n\nI also suggest to make a test with a for loop over all possible source data structures resulting from our historical test runs (i.e. common/matlab/fieldtrip/yyyymmdd)."
