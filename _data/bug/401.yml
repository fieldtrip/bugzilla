Keep in mind that external people should also be able to add their references. But you can try to convince me otherwise ;-)"

          Google Scholar was actually the main reason I thought of adding a BibTeX-thing to our wiki; you can have it automatically output bibtex entries (go to 'Voorkeuren voor Scholar' --> 'Bibliografieprogramma', or whatever the English equivalent is). This will make the copy/pasting into our wiki very easy. I'm not sure, but I think pubmed should have something similar.

          Having pre-formatted plaintext is nice, but with a lot of references and multiple people adding them, the format will probably get quite messy. Currently on the production wiki, there are e.g. first and last names switched around and that sort of thing.

          Convinced? ;)

          My dokuwiki BibTeX plugin is now finished, and it works! See http://fieldtrip_test.fcdonders.nl/doku.php?id=publications for an example. Entries are automatically sorted by year (descending) first, then by author (ascending).

          I also wrote a Google Scholar bibtex scraper, but as you can see on that page there is quite some crappy stuff in Google Scholar's database. Let's discuss whether we really want to start with this automatic scraping.

          Also, the page now only contains the first 100 hits (out of 107) for "fieldtrip fcdonders nl" OR "www.ru.nl/donders/fieldtrip" OR "www.ru.nl/neuroimaging/fieldtrip". Google then decided:

          "
          We're sorry...

          ... but your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.

          hehe :)

        thetext: I found a problem with the plugin, which causes the headers (2011, 2010, etc.) to not show up in the ToC. Maybe I can fix it in the next day or two (my vacation :) ), but otherwise it will have to wait until, say, 2,5 weeks from now (and until Arjen fixes the 2010 reference list, anyway :P ).
