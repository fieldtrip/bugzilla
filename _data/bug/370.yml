          private/prepare_time_freq_data calls fixdimord, whereas the dimord should now be fixed in ft_checkdata.

          todo
          - remove the call to fixdimord
          - remove the fixdimord from fieldtrip/private (*)

          *) there are two, one in private and the other in public/private -> check which one is the external and first remove the external, svn commit, and then (if needed) move the actual original file to the correct place (and commit)

          I closed all the bugs that I resolved earlier today. These have been discussed
          at the Fieldtrip meeting and should not show up any more at the next meeting.
          If you feel that one of these bugs should not have been closed, you have to
          reopen it.
