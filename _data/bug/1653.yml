          I added artinis for now:
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/realtime/implementation?&#implementations_for_aquisition_systems
          But I am not sure if all information about the interfacing is correct. Robert, do you know enough to check or should I ask someone from Artinis to check?

          Current documentation is not bad. It would be nice to make it slightly mor specific, i.e., mention hostname:port, (what is gheir default port?) and perhaps  add a screenshot of the config window in their software wher something needs to be set/enabled. You do need artinis to help out hee.

Apparently, you need to edit a .ini-file for realtime streaming, in which you also can define the socket-port. \nIn the documentation that was send to me are also some details on the datastream itself (i.e. it's ascii lines, terminate by \\n) - that information is probably too specific for the FieldTrip page, isn't it?"

          you could point to the Artinis documentation. I.e. knowing that the documentation exists (and if possible referring to it by name) would be useful for people that want to do it.

          does not have to be online, paper will also do. Just a pointer to the "Artinis reference manual" is fine.

          Just like we refer to the Talairach atlas, which also only exists on paper.
