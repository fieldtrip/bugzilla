          fixedsampleinfo currently rejects timelock structures that do not have a trial field (where cfg.keeptrials was 'no') as they are then treated incorrectly as a raw structure.

          --
          ??? Cell contents reference from a non-cell array object.
          Error in ==> fixsampleinfo at 95
                  offset(i) = time2offset(data.time{i}, data.fsample);

          perhaps I'm missing something

          The statement "I removed the lines around 175" should have read "I removed the lines around 591"

        thetext: "there is one potential case where the change won't work. Imagine \n\nft_checkdata(timelock, 'datatype', 'raw', 'hassampleinfo', 'yes')\n\nwhere timelock is the output from ft_timelockanalysis with keeptrials=yes and without sampleinfo.\n\nThis also applies for other input types that can be converted to raw. The conversion will be done from line 228 onward, whereas the sampleinfo is added on line 175 only in case if the data is raw at that moment.\n\nactually, now that I think of it the whole section \n% the ft_datatype_XXX functions ensures the consistency of the XXX datatype\n% and provides a detailled description of the dataformat and its history\n\nis done before all conversions, which means that the converted input data xxx data after xxx2yyy is not passed through ft_datatype_yyy\n\nThe initial pass through ft_datatype_xxx is ok, but after the conversion it should also be passed through ft_datatype_yyy.\n\nI suggest to change the sections\n      if isequal(dtype(iCell), {'source'}) && isvolume\n        data = volume2source(data);\n        ....\n into\n      if isequal(dtype(iCell), {'source'}) && isvolume\n        data = volume2source(data);\n        data = ft_checkdata_source(data);\n        ....\nand idem for all other conversions"

          I have implemented it as suggested in comment 3. All calls to ft_datatype_raw include the optional hassampleinfo flag.
