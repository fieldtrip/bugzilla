          What needs to be replaced:

          Change this general procedure:
          *****
          cfg = [];
          cfg.keepindividual = 'yes';
          gavg = ft_whatevergrandaverage(cfg,data1, data2, data3, dataN)
          cfg = [];
          cfg....
          stats = ft_whateverstatistics(cfg,gavg)
          *****


          Into this general procedure:
          *****
          cfg = [];
          cfg....
          stats = ft_whateverstatistics(cfg, data1, data2, data3, dataN)
          OR
          stats = ft_whateverstatistics(cfg, combineddata{:})
          *****



          This is important, because it forces people to realize that what they put into the statistics (and other) functions, is nothing more than a bunch of datasets after each other. This makes thinking about the design-matrix (or any option that uses multiple datasets) much easier and intuitive.

          The nastier thing is, is that some tutorials (like the above), don't explicitly generate the grand-averaged data-thing, but load it from a mat-file. So it would involve inserting some new code, or possibly changing some bits related to data-management.

        thetext: Sorry if I caused any confusion. The thing that should be changed is not the computation of the average per subject, that is handled by ft_timelockanalysis of course. What should be changed is the usage of the output ft_grandaverageXXX with cfg.keepindividual=yes for statistics. I.e. using ft_grandaverageXXX as a 'gathering function' should be avoided in the documentation. If no grand-average is desired, then users should use a for loop and a cell-array to gather all the individual subjects, and use that cell-array in the call to ft_statisticsXXX. Alternatively users can also hardcode all the individual data-sets as input to the statistics function, like ft_statistics(cfg,data1,data2,dataN). That last option might be better as an example, but I don't remember whether the statistics in the tutorial is done on a lot of datasets. I.e. for 20 datasets the example will not provide a lot of clarity, and a for-loop+cell-array should be used. We could discuss in the meeting.

          Hi Nietzsche, could you give this one a try? I think Lilla already sums up where the documentation needs to be changed. We should then also change the corresponding test_tutorial_xxx functions.

          To tease apart the GA.individual field: I don't know whether it's worth to write a separate function. It needs to be done only once. In other words, it does not have to be pretty code.

          figures: these do not need to changed. I have tested to code to make sure that the plots still look the same.

          Two things to check:
          1) I remember that the cluster in that part of the tutorial is awful, because it is marginally significant. On some runs, p is smaller than 0.05, in others it is bigger. I hope you checked multiple times :)
          Maybe it would be wise to add some sentences to the tutorial about this, and also point the reader to the "newly" added confidence interval for permutation tests (i.e. there is a warning if the CI includes 0.05)

          2) We need to check whether the neighbours are actually different between the two method. They should be the same. The plotting obviously has to be different, because using a 2D layout there are no 3D sensor positions available. Let me have a look at this one and check what goes wrong where, because I know the prepare_neighbours code better :)
