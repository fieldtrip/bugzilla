          use ft_selectdata for this

          make consistent with cfg.vartrllength in timelockanalysis

          this needs to apply to functions:

          ft_preprocessing
          ft_freqanalysis
          ft_timelockanalysis
          ft_XXXgrandaverage
          ft_XXXstatistics

          and possibly others

          last week in the FT meeting we discussed whether cfg.latency is needed/desired. I (=Robert) argued against it in general, using the following arguments:
          1) time is easy to select in the plot, whereas channels are not so easily selected
          2) it does not affect the output of the computations in the window of interest
          3) it does not significantly increase the size of the output data
          4) it does not significantly increase the computational costs
          5) functions that need it, presently rely on ft_definetrial/ft_preprocessing.

          The latest implementation of ft_selectdata allows for selections of latency for all supported inputs. So the user can do it him/herself as a separate step. There is presently not a need to implement this in all FT functions.
