          This particularly pertains to the discussion that we had in the FT meeting today in which we decided to update the guidelines for the structure in the tutorial.

          Hi Johanna,

          I wanted to assing this bug to myself but then I remembered that you have an assigned bug of "reconstructing the beamformer tutorial", so I have assigned this to you too. I hope it is OK with you.

          I have 99% completed bug 414, so now moving to this bug.  I made most of the 'guidelines' updates to this tutorial, except for having a nice figure in the Procedures section, for example such as http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/eventrelatedaveraging?&#procedure.

          I don't have any example figures like this in .svg to edit/modify.  Can either someone explain to me how to do this and give me an existing .svg file I can edit, or if Robert/Lilla has more experience and willing to do this last part, could I pass this task on to them?

        thetext: figure made and added to 'procedure'.
