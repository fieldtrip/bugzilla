          peer('allowuser',{...}) is not updated properly (and probably also allowgroup etc). To reproduce this problem startup 2 slaves, one with peerslave('allowuser', {yourusername}) and one without restrictions. Now do the following:

          >>clear all
          >>peerinfo

          This gives you 2 peers (assumaning there are no other peers in the network)

          >>peermaster('allowuser','yourusername')
          >>peerinfo

          This gives the same nr as peers as before

          >>clear all
          >>peermaster('allowuser','yourusername')

          Only now you get the desired nr of peers (namely 1).

        thetext: "The situation was that the update would take 5 seconds. The allowXXX is implemented in the discover thread, and only when a previous discovery expired (i.e. after 5 seconds), the new discovery of the same host would be processed and filtered according to the allowXXX rules.\n\nI have changed the code of the mex file: after updating the allowXXX rules, the peerlist is erased and all hosts have to be re-discovered. Consequently, all announced peers will be compared with the allowXXX rules.  \n\nSee SVN revision 1568 on http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=1568"
