        thetext: "For a given .lay file, the locations are consistent regardless of which subset of channels are remaining for plotting.  For now, use EEG1010.lay for the Brain Products MR compatible cap, for most consistency with the standard layout.  (Although it was noted to be slightly different than the same subset of channels plotted with EEG1005.lay).   \n\nLonger-term solution is via bug 890."
