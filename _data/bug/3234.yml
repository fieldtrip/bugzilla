          Hi there,

          [Sorry, I could have done the following myself but my github installation on Windows 10 at work remains broken after several attempts]

          I looked at the code for the modulation index in ft_crossfrequencyanalysis. The code has one mistake/typo.

          Line 186 says: mi(i,j) = nansum(P.* (log2(P)-log2(Q)))/log2(pha);
          The last variable 'pha' has to be 'nbin' instead.

          It also uses log2 instead of log, which does not make a difference in the results, but for the sake of consistency with the original paper (below) it might be good to replace log2 with log (only line 186).

          The calculation is made in some separate steps, and since the log calculations are not so transparent for me I tested the results with the results of the calculation based on the code of the original author (personal correspondence, via-via), and the results are identical. Just a good check.

          The following paper can be cited as the original idea and calculation of the MI for neurophysiological data:

          I have implemented the changes as suggested and added the following to the help of the function.

          % Various metrics for cross-frequency coupling have been introduced in a number of
          % scientific publications, but these do not use a sonsistent method naming scheme,
          % nor implement it in exactly the same way. The particular implementation in this
          % code tries to follow the most common format, generalizing where possible. If you
          % want details about the algorithms, please look into the code.
