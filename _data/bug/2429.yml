          Created attachment 579
          Indivisual source vs. standard source

          Dear all,

          first of all: Happy New Year!

          I already sent the following issue to the mailing list seeking advise, but without much help (19/12/2013 subject EEG Electrode / Volume Alignment Problem). I also spent more time checking every step in building the BEM and leadfield and doing the source analysis but I'm lost.

          I uploaded the relevant data (individual MRI, BEM-Model, Leadfield, electrode locations, standard MRI, BEM-Model, Leadfield, electrode locations as well as a sample script) to wetransfer: http://we.tl/7e4T7q0VCY  (online until 14/01/14)

          As I wrote in my mail, I can nicely localize source activity (e.g. visual N1) using the standard BEM, MRI and our standard EEG electrode positions (see Berlin_EEG_Head.mat in the .zip-file from wetransfer).

          However, when I use the individual MRI (realigned) to build a BEM-Model and then a leadfield and use this for the source analysis, the source appears to be rotated by 90Â° to temporal cortex.

          Interestingly, depending on which landmarks I use for the MRI realignment, the sources are shifted clockwise (when using Nasion and Left/Right) or counterclockwise (when using the Commissures). I therefore assume that the alignment in ft_electroderealign between the BEM-Model and the EEG-electrodes fails.

          Thanks a lot for your help!

          Julian

          Dear all,

          sorry to have bothered you.
          The error seems to have been on this side of the screen: The mesh, volume, grid and leadfield had different units (mm in mesh and volume, cm in grid and leadfield) which I assume caused the problem.

          I'll double check but hopefully keeping an eye on the units solved my problem.

          All the best

          Julian

          Hi Julian,
          This is JM writing on Nietzsche's bugzilla account:
          We're changing the status of the bug, since it ssems it's invalid. Feel free to re-open if it remains a problem.
