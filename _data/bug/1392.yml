          the function does


          % do the general setup of the function
          ft_defaults
          ft_preamble help
          ft_preamble callinfo
          ft_preamble trackconfig
          ft_preamble loadvar data

          and in the first ft_defaults call the path should be set to include fieldtrip/utilities, where ft_preamble is located.

          Can you check your path
          - prior to ft_defaults
          - after ft_defaults?

          Can you do "which ft_preamble"?

          That was probably it. there were some directories of older FT versions in my path, including /utilities. After removing these from the path, and running ft_defaults again, things work ok again: /utilities is in the path.

          thanks!

          I cleaned up my bugzilla list by changing the status from resolved (either fixed or wontfix) into closed. If you don't agree, please reopen the bug.
