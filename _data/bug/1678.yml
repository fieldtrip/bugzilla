          See http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/visual_artifact_rejection

          Figures sometimes are a screencap from the entire UI, sometimes a cut-out screencap containing the figure-window, and sometimes a screencap where all UI-elements are cut-out.

        thetext: Looked at a few of the other tutorial pages and have the UI-elements removed.  For the purpose of artifact rejection I think it is sufficient to only have the figure window, I will work on this

          In trying to recreate the last figure (using ft_databrowser) I noticed that the code shown in the wiki didn't work, so this has been updated.
          Furthermore, I did not recreate the figures (pre and post-click) because it is most optimal as currently shown - hence this will be the only figure not showing the figure window, the rest all show the figure window but without the UI-elements.
