          You are right, in 64-bit mode, it doesn't crash, although ultimately I think it will because memory usage increases every time a new buffer is created and destroyed. This memory is not released if you stop the loop and execute clear mex.
          Using 32-bit Matlab2010a, it crashes after a few attempts.
          I am sorry, I forgot to mention this 32-bit detail.

          I indeed also noticed the memory leak upon many iterations. That is something to look into.

          But first for reproducing the crash: how can I start MATLAB 2010a in 32 bit mode? Oh... I already know.

          It might be that a bug was fixed but that the mexmaci was not recompiled to reflect the latest code changes. Some recent cleanups of the fieldtrip SVN directories and esp. the mex files make it difficult to track,
