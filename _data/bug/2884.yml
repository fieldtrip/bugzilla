          Hi there,

          While doing some standard pre-processing I have come across a bug in ft_definetrial. The error is not in the script as it is the same one I have been using for a while. The data is not an issue as I have already pre-processed this data before with no problems.

          I would attached one subjects' data from 1 block but it is too large.
          The same problem comes up with any c,rfDC datafile
          This is using the latest version of Fieldtrip

          Below is the script

          % triggers
          trig = 10:2:48;

                 cfg = [];
                 cfg.headerfile = 'c,rfDC';
                 cfg.datafile = cfg.headerfile;
                 cfg.channel = {'all'};
                 cfg.continuous = 'yes';
                 cfg.trialfun = 'ft_trialfun_general';
                 cfg.trialdef.eventtype = 'TRIGGER';
                 cfg.trialdef.eventvalue = trig;
                 cfg.trialdef.prestim = 1; %seconds
                 cfg.trialdef.poststim = 2; %seconds
                 cfg.headerformat = '4d';
                 cfg.detrend = 'yes';
                 cfg = ft_definetrial(cfg);

          My apologies if this is not the correct way to submit a bug, this is the first time I am doing this.

          Many Thanks
          Kevin
                 data{idir} = ft_preprocessing(cfg);

          The error message is:

          Error using ft_definetrial (line 184)
          no trials were defined, see FT_DEFINETRIAL for help.

          This is the same error when my colleagues get when trying to pre-process their data. We have gone back to some participants data that we know is good and should have any issue.

          The error persists even wehn changing the script slightly for looking at different data sets with different trigger values, or different trials events.

          Thanks
          Kevin

           Hi Kevin and  Jim,

          I got the same issue today. The error is due to ft_trialfun_general introduced in r10345

          https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/diff?spec=svn10345&r=10345&format=side&path=/trunk/trialfun/ft_trialfun_general.m&old_path=/trunk/trialfun/ft_trialfun_general.m&old=9586

          No clue what's the eventtype=gui option but probably it's a new feature Robert is working on

          Diego

          bummer, that is indeed something I have been messing with. The option was there for ages already (it is used in SPM), but I made some "improvements" to it.

          @Kevin and Diego: would it be possible to send me the header and event (i.e. output of ft_read_header and ft_read_event) of the dtaaset, together with the cfg that you pass into ft_definetrial? That should allow me to debug...

          Hi Robert,

          Thank you for your prompt reply. I cannot attach cfg, hdr and event becuase it was too big. But using tutorial data and inserting a debug break point in ft_trialfun_general line 95 you'll get the info you need

          dataset = '/home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/Subject01.ds';

          cfg = [];
          cfg.dataset                 = dataset;
          cfg.trialdef.eventtype      = 'backpanel trigger';
          cfg.trialdef.prestim        = 1;
          cfg.trialdef.poststim       = 2;
          cfg.trialdef.eventvalue     = 3;
          cfg = ft_definetrial(cfg);
