          I tried to checkout the SVN trunk from a computer outside of the Radboud University network. Authentication succeeds, but after about 20 files, there is no progress. I waited for 15 minutes --- and there is no network activity.

          With a second run, it continues, but hangs again.

          To reproduce:
          $ time svn checkout svn+ssh://borreu@svn.fcdonders.nl/home/svnroot/fieldtrip/trunk

          I issued this command on a laptop with Ubuntu 10.4.

          it might be that the (shared vmware) svn server is too busy. When I ssh to svn I can see your process in top.

          Please try again and keep an eye on top

        thetext: Ok. I can't reproduce now, so it definitely seems to be related to load of the server. Right now it seems extremely low-loaded :). But still, I think it should not happen since it shapes the first impression of developers.
