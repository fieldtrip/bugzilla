        thetext: "I have used ft_databrowser recently and did not have any issues with it. I see from the screenshot that you are using an old (2013) MATLAB version. I suspect that to relate to the problem you have. \n\nI propose you use the MATLAB debugger. Start the data browser, create the problem and then scroll up all the way to the very first error. That is the function in which you should set a breakpoint using the MATLAB debugger; this will allow you to see what is wrong."
