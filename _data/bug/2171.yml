          (In reply to comment #1)

          Furthermore, I have provided a link on the page http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/deprecated where deprecated functions and options are to be listed. I realize that the list on that page is very incomplete, but nevertheless it might help in deciding on the expiry date.

        thetext: I removed all the references to legacy code in ft_freqanalysis, removed all trunk/compat functions dealing/containing with this old code, and removed 3 faqs detailing the differences between the legacy and the specest code. The info not covered by the other faqs I put into a new one (i.e. absolute phase convention).

        thetext: I removed all files from compat/ which had as their contents the compatibility wrapper for non-ft_-prefixed calls, as of r8264. I thought I'd wait with all the other compat files to see what this would bring about first :)

          Resolved for now, if we want to delete stuff in the future I propose to make a new bug out of it.

          Of course, if my recent delete action (revision 9150) causes troubles, this bug should be reopened :)
