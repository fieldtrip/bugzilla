        thetext: right now it requires a sens.chanpos and uses the inverse distance in the computation of the fixed channels. It would makse sense to also support the averaging of all neighbours with equal weight.

          this is indeed an easy one, but how to name the method? currently, we have 'nearest', 'spline' and 'slap'. The name 'nearest' does not exclusively define that it stands for 'weigh according to distance'. For historical reasons, we can keep 'nearest' as is and name the new method 'average', but would that be confusing for new users? (on the other hand, in the worst case they just have to get used to it)

          I just made it so:
          svn ci ft_channelrepair.m test/test_ft_channelrepair.m -m "enhancement #2406 - channelrepair supports an equal averaging of neighbours method"
          Sending        ft_channelrepair.m
          Sending        test/test_ft_channelrepair.m
          Transmitting file data ..
          Committed revision 9012.
