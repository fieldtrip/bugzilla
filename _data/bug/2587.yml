          First we should get a feel of how the knowledge forum works in general. Does everybody have access? In particular, people form the DCC?

          Then see how we can link this to the EDA-meeting mailing list.

          I checked with our TG on

          1) https://knowledgeforum.dccn.nl -> It is managed by Pim Mostert and Yu Luo. I will contact them with the question whether it can be linked to the eda mailing list.

          2) eda mailing list -> There are presently 108 email addresses subscribed to it, i.e. way more than the ~20 people that are the regular visitors of the meeting.
