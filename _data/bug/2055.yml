          See my email on the list to Markus.

          Also the other ft_read_xxx functions might have options that are relevant but missing from the documentation.

          documentation has been updated.

          in addition, the key format has been changed into dataformat to make it consistent with other reading functions. format is still supported for backward compatibility

          in addition, the string comparisons have been replaced with a switch box.

          in addition, the checking of toolboxes has changed slightly, i.e. it is checked and silently added to the path when needed (handling of spm stays as it was: it is a bit clunky but I did not dare to touch it)

          in addition, reading analyze files now defaults to spm, if Darren Webber's code is to be used, 'dataformat' = 'analyze_old'

          in addition, reading neuromag files now defaults to mne, if meg-pd is to be used, 'dataformat' = 'neuromag_fif_old'

          in addition, I created a test function.
