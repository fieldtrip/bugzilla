        thetext: "see http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=1407#c26\n\nThe problem is not specifically related to the EGI, but seems a generic issue. Therefore I made this bug out of it\n\n----- \n\nI've looked into why if I try to read an event with v2, v1 is still used. I\ncall read_event as follows:\n\nevent_v2 =\nft_read_event('C:\\Users\\Ingrid\\Documents\\EGI_hdEEGdocs\\MFF_API_2012-04-09\\testfiles\\Long64ChannelWithEvents.mff',\n'headerformat', 'egi_mff_v2')\n\nHowever on line 109 in ft_read_event, eventformat comes back empty:\n% get the options\neventformat      = ft_getopt(varargin, 'eventformat');\n\nand therefore gets set to v1 in line 112\nif isempty(eventformat)\n  % only do the autodetection if the format was not specified\n  eventformat = ft_filetype(filename);\nend\n\nI tried to debug the ft_getopt function, to see why it doesn't return\neventformat = 'egi_mff_v2', but when I put a debugging stop, I get the popup\nmessage that it's shadowed by ft_getopt.mexw64 file. Could this explain the\ndifferent behavior on different systems?"

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #0)\n\n@Ingrid, could you try out the test code in \n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/browse/trunk/test/test_ft_getopt.m\n\nwhich you should also find in your local svn copy.\n\nWe don't use win64 that much, so the specific mex file could be the problem. You can also try by deleting the mex file and use the m-file implementation instead. They should result in the same output, but the mex file should be the (much) faster one.\n\nNote that these mex files and the ft_getopt.m are in many different xxx/private directories (and also in utilities), so make ure you don't mix up the different copies when testing.\n\n\n@Jorn (CC), could you also check this on your 64 bit windows?"

        thetext: I'm using win64 most of the time and it works for me (as well the testscript as everything else I am doing with FT). May be related to the fact that I got visual studio installed?

          There was no problem with the getopt mex file. The problem was, I called the ft_read_event with "headerformat' not with 'eventformat'

          ft_read_event('C:\Users\Ingrid\Documents\EGI_hdEEGdocs\MFF_API_2012-04-09\testfiles\Long64ChannelWithEvents.mff',
          'headerformat', 'egi_mff_v2')

          Note, I've also ran the test_ft_getopt.m, works all ok.
