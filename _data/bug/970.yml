          The source.mom output is always vectorial, so that for scalar beamformer it is necessary to call ft_sourcedescriptives with projectmom = 'yes'
          It would be handy to have the solution already in scalar form, without having to call other functions.

        thetext: the idea is that the pcc beamformer can deal with more than one dipole per location. the fixedori option for sourceanalysis in this context does not make sense. sourcedescriptives has the required intelligence indeed. if there is a way in which it can be easily detected that just a single dipole per location is in the sourcemodel, support for fixedori would be OK.
