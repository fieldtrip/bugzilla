          Hi Haiteng,
          Would you mind taking this one?
          The usual course of action is to first reproduce the bug.
          Sara had problems uploading the relevant data, but it seems that she just uses Subject01.mri (you can find this one somewhere on /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data). I suspect that the bug is a problem on her end, but we should try first. If it indeed happens to lie at the user's end, verify whether the function has been properly used (i.e. did Sara press 'q' when exiting, or did she just close the figure? The former is how it should be, the latter probably will produce no output).

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #1)
          Hi JM,
             Yes, I think Sara only needs mri . I just test it and everything is fine. At this moment ,  Sara probably doesn't have enough RAM memory to proceed since (data/dataout/) could be very large. Sara,  Could you please add clear data dataout (it is not used later anyway) before ft_read_mri?  Let me know whether it works.
                                 Haiteng

        thetext: "(In reply to Sara Rombetto from comment #4)\nHi Sara, \n   What do you mean by 'no output'. After you identify it by pressing either n/l/r for fiducials ,then  press 'q' to save and exit.  The Fiduicals are stored in MRI2.  Have  you ever see the plot of the anatomical mri before you identify fiducials ?  This issue is not related to the data."

          Now I can see the fiducials in different colors (blu, red and green) and I can see the output.
          I cannot understand where was the problem...but it looks like it is solved now!
          thanks
