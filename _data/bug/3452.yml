          Hi,

          When using a logical vector for cfg.trials in ft_redefinetrial, the feedback written to the command window is wrong. Line 122 in ft_redefinetrial is:
          if fb, fprintf('selecting %d trials\n', length(cfg.trials)); end
          which would mean that it would output the length of the vector (the total number of trials), rather than the sum of the vector. I looked for "fprintf('selecting %d trials\n', length(cfg.trials))" in other .m files from FT (version 2018/09/12) to see if it happens elsewhere. I found 1 other function, ft_nonlinearassociation (starting line 92), but this function has a correction a line later for when logical cfg.trials is used.

          Thanks!
          Nir Ofir
