          the sensor type for some systems (including but not limited to bti148) seems  inconsistent for the _planar and _planar_combined varieties:

          >> ft_senstype(ft_senslabel('bti148_planar_combined'),'meg_axial')

          ans =

               1

          >> ft_senstype(ft_senslabel('bti148_planar'),'meg_planar')

          ans =

               1

          >> ft_senstype(ft_senslabel('bti148_planar_combined'),'meg_planar')

          ans =

               0

          I would expect that the first line would return 0 and the third line 1. I would think that once planar sensors are combined, they are still planar.

        thetext: "It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.\n\n\nFrom the senslabel alone it is not always possible to correctly infer the senstype. The convention currently is to represent the combined planar channels (at least for systems that need a synthetic planar gradient as an intermediate step to get there, i.e. with  chanX_dV and chanX_dH pair per original sensor) in the labels with the original sensor names (to facilitate plotting etc. \nTherefore, it's by construction impossible to identify the senstype correctly. I know that it's been a long while since this was first submitted, but is there any recollection of the direct cause of submitting this in the first place?"

Probably this was submitted when working on a function to get the M/EEG layouts and associated channel types in CoSMoMVPA [1], in particular the cosmo_meeg_senstype_collection function [2]. Even though I don't remember everything in detail, looking at the code [2] it seems I added some processor functions to get around issues with senstypes being different than what I expected (@fix_neuromag306_planar_combinations,@fix_neuromag306_combined_with_mag,@fix_neuromag122_planar_name,@fix_eeg10XX_senstype). Some other processor functions there deal with older versions of FieldTrip that have presumably been updated in the past (@fix_ctf275_planar_old_fieldtrip,@fix_eeg10XX_channels_old_fieldtrip,@fix_yokogawa440_planar_old_fieldtrip,@fix_egiX_channels_old_fieldtrip).\n\nFor operations with CoSMoMVPA it would seems it is fine to close this issue, and I understand this issue may not be of top priority. \n\n[1] https://github.com/CoSMoMVPA/CoSMoMVPA\n[2] https://github.com/CoSMoMVPA/CoSMoMVPA/blob/master/mvpa/cosmo_meeg_senstype_collection.m"
