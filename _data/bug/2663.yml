          Hi,

          ft_rejectvisual/summary works really well for most metrics but it does not plot the correct values when you want the minimum values across trials and channels.

          With metric = 'min', rejectvisual_summary first gets the lowest value for each channel [1], and then it takes the maximum value across trials [2]. It should take the minimum value across trials too.

          Example data:
          ChanA = [-5, -2, 3];
          ChanB = [-10, -5, 0];
          ChanC = [5, 2, -2];

          If the metric is min, you get: ChanA = -5, ChanB = -10, ChanC = -2. Then it takes the max value, which is -2, while it should be -10. I suggest to flip the sign before computing the max. So to insert at line 214:

          if strcmp(info.metric, 'min')
              level = level * -1;
          end

          [maxperchan maxpertrl maxperchan_all maxpertrl_all] = set_maxper(level, info.chansel, info.trlsel);

          if strcmp(info.metric, 'min')
              maxperchan = maxperchan * -1;
              maxpertrl = maxpertrl * -1;
              maxperchan_all = maxperchan_all * -1;
              maxpertrl_all = maxpertrl_all * -1;
              level = level * -1;  % see point below
          end

          The second part is necessary to have the correct sign in the plots. I'm not sure about the second "level = level * -1", because by flipping the sign again the color palette is the opposite of the color palette for the other metrics (red -> dangerously high values) and there is no colorbar with interpretable values.

          I can commit the changes if you agree.

          You have obviously give this a lot of thought ;-) If you trust this to work well, I would say please commit!

          Sure, I'll commit the changes (I'll be on vacation for two weeks now, so don't expect it soon). I think I waited at the time to see if somebody else had a better overview than me of the steps in ft_rejectvisual.
