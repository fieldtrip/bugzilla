          - does it compare conditions (in stead of activation v.s. baseline)?

Or is the functionality to trivial to be in the toolbox?"

          The help is updated. The distinction with ft_freqbaseline is made more clear. Also the input config option 'cfg.baselinetype' has been modified to 'cfg.comparisontype' to further elaborate on this discrepancy.
