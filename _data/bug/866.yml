          Hi,

          here, at the MPI we use an actiCap with 59 electrodes and equidistant montage. When I calculate the neighbours of each electrode with the ft_neighbourselection function, it looks OK if the cfg.neighbourdist = 50 (see attached file: nb_plot_50.jpg), but it looks pretty bad when cfg.neighbourdist = 40 (see: nb_plot_40.jpg).

I also tried to use the triangulation method, but then I got 7 neighbors in average per electrode that I think is a bit too many. \nI posted as a bug because I did not understand why neighbors are missing at some part while not at the other parts when it is supposed to be an equidistant montage."

          Hey Lilla,

          I just took a more detailled look. So, the problem most likely occurs because the neighbourselection method is projecting the sensors on a 2D plane, meaning that the positions will be slightly off. However, I can work on a template that looks optimal. I will do that today or tomorrow, depending on how fast (and buggy) my data analysis is  - cause I prefer working on my data ;P
          Can you let me know how the corresponding layout file for your cap is called?

          This is what I came up with - looks symmetric and with not too much overlap. Let me know what you think!
          And if you let me know the name of the corresponding layout-file for the EEG cap, then I can store the template in the FT directory with a proper name ;)

          Hey Lilla,

          you should put neighbours in the cfg. The only second argument allowed in neighbourplot would be data, in case neighbourplot should compute the neighbours.

          cfg = [];
          cfg.elec = elec;
          cfg.neighbours = neighbours;
          ft_neighbourplot(cfg);


          that should do. Anyway, the error has nothing to do with this, but with 'someone' placing code outside the function (Hi Robert! ;)

          Should work now (or, if you have no access to svn, just move the last end to the end of the function)

          yes, sorry.
          so, let's call it mpi_59_channels. Are you working with one that I have sent? I can't check it now, is RM (=right mastoid) included? If yes, then may it is useful to tell in the documentation that channel selection should be used if people do not want that included.
