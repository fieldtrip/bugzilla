          Which data file are you talking about?
          I think the loading function itself is fine and the position of some sensors is wrong even before we load the date into FT. So I don't think it's necessary to fix FT codes.

          The "RMx" refers to reference magnetometer sensors about 15 cm aways from the helmet, but within the Dewar. Yokogawa does not give location and orientation
          for them in the software (MEG160 -> Edit -> Channel Info: See attached figure).
          The RMs were included upon the wish of Vladimir / SPM to have all
          possible sensors. The RMs in other Yokogawa systems have position and orientation. If the absence of pos/ori causes trouble they should probably
          be removed at some stage.

          Just to make sure, FT doesn't give an error when we load the data of reference sensors, which is not defined in grad, right?

          I don't use reference sensors for now, but might use them for noise reduction in the future.

          Dear Kaoru,

          I am still struggling with channel sequences from your system. I will attach a file, which I believe is originally from you. But it does not have any
          reference channels at all (MEG160 -> Edit -> Channel Info). Can you attach
          here a small file with your current (final ?) channel arrangement including
          reference channels, if there are any ?

          Many thanks, Till

          using the attached test file, I have made the script test_bug804 which basically contains

          cd /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/bug804
          cfg = [];
          cfg.dataset = 'amano.ave';
          data = ft_preprocessing(cfg);
          ft_plot_sens(data.grad);

          the script now runs through without a problem, hence I changed the status into "worksforme"
