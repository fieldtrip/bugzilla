        right now the methods interactive and fiducial are mixed. The proposal is to change it so that

        method=fiducial means that
        1a) fiducials are present in the cfg and are used
        1b) fiducials are not present in the cfg, a GUI is used to click them

        method=interactive means that
        2) an interactive GUI is shown with optional template data and optional axes that allows the user to specify translation, rotation and scaling. This should use the shared code in ft_interactiverealign.

        Since these methods are all interactive, we can change the code and break compatibility. Users will see that they don't get the expected GUI any more. The command line should give a warning to explain it as well.
