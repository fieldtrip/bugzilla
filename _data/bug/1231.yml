          the issue is that here [] has a meaning whereas throughout much of the code, [] is treated as being not defined.

          we could add a fourth input to ft_getopt to overrule the default behavior (of defaulting to the default) and return the meaningful [] in case it is present.

          Committed revision 5055.

          Added functionality:

          % The optional fourth argument allows you to specify whether
          % or not an empty value in the configuration structure/cell array should be
          % interpreted as meaningful. If emptymeaningful = 1, then an empty
          % configuration option will be returned if present. If emptymeaningful = 0,
          % then the specified default will be returned if an empty value is
          % encountered. The default value for emptymeaningful = 0.

          Note that the MEX-files have NOT been compiled for Mac, I only added Win32, Win64, and Linux64 versions. Given that the fourth argument is not yet used, this seemed safe to commit to me.

          What needs to be done for a mac compilation?  Us mac users need it!

          I'm naive to .mex production, but I can compile from source and upload if this is all that is entailed.

          I just compiled it, do an svn update and it should appear (at least for MacOS 64-bit,

          32-bit will follow shortly

          PS: you can do it yourself by running the ft_compile_mex function

          Thanks, Craig! But apparently JM is already on it.

          @JM: ft_compile_mex only compiles mexfiles for the platform from which it is called, right? So if I run it on, say, Linux64, I only get .mexa64 files I think?

          No it didn't, the problem with the 'Access denied' mex-files already existed before I committed the fix.
