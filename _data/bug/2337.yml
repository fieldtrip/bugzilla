The fact is that when I execute my script, it appears an error, calling to freq.time:\nError in ft_freqbaseline (line 103)\nfreqOut.time   = freq.time; \nAnd in my freq output it does not appear any time. Actually in the description of topoplotER, is clear that with powerSpectrum is not necessary time. I think it could be a bug, and I can not fix it.\n\nThanks!"

          Hi Frederico,

          ft_freqbaseline should not have been called, as that pertains to normalizing time-frequency data (using a baseline window somewhere along the time-axis, usually pre-stim).

          Could you attach a mat file with your freq structure and your cfg to this bug (or send it in another way, e.f. through dropbox, if it is too large)? That will help to reproduce the issue.

          thanks
          Robert

          Hey Robert,

          Is not possible to me right now upload the .mat. I have done two screenshots, maybe this is enough, if is not, I will do it later (it is 500MB/each). I really don't see the fail, I am becoming crazy! haha

          Regards

          the screenshot does not give enough information as to why ft_multiplotER ends up calling ft_freqbaseline.

          large uploads to bugzilla indeed don't work. Please see http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_should_i_send_example_data_to_the_developers

          Yeah.. I know, is not enough information. Okay, I've tried to upload there by coping the file, but it seems that it has not been copied. Can I copy it directly by typing ftp://ftp.fcdonders.nl/pub/incoming/ and upload it? I've tried but I don't see any buttom to upload, I tried to copy it directly by moving the .mat file, but it is like if it download in my computer. What should I do?

          I am so sorry for the inconveniences, I am only using Fieldtrip for one week.

          Thank you
          Best,

          Federico

          The exchange of freq.mat somehow failed:

          >> cd ~/Downloads/
          >> load freq.mat
          unexpected end-of-file while reading compressed data
          unexpected end-of-file while reading compressed data
          unexpected end-of-file while reading compressed data
          Error using load
          Can't read file /Volumes/Data/roboos/Downloads/freq.mat.

          So freq.mat is appears to be corrupt.

          The download for cfg.mat is still busy (at only 100kB/s, will take another hour). But I don't understand why cfg.mat is so large (>400MB). It should only contain the cfg structure, right?

          Can you save the files once more and reupload? Which matlab version on which operating system are you using?

          you mean that you resolved the problem? What was causing the issue then?
