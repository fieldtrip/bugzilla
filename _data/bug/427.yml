          see the COMNT in the attached screenshot.

          It can be reproduced by loading the attached mat file and then
          > ft_multiplotER(cfg, timelock{:})

          Created attachment 21
          here is the screen shot after the fix

          I changed the way the comment is constructed. Initially it used the inpufile function, which however never works when operating on varargin{:}. Therefore I decided to name the input 'inputXX' and numbering the XX

          the screen shot after the fix shows 10 inputs, whereas there are only 4 in the cell array.

          In case the inputs are specified as
          > ft_multiplotER(cfg, avgFIC, avgFC)
          then it would be nice to keep the actual variable names. In case of a cell-array input, that is not possible.

          the variable timelock is by the way a 4x3 cell-array,
          so it gave twelve lines, rather than 10, and 4 was not a value to be expected
