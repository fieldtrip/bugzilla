        thetext: "Dear ft developers,\nmay I suggest a change in ft_plot_topo around lines 230 - 260\nspecifically to plot the surface first and then the isolines.\n\nthe reason is the following:\nwhen I export topographies to a vector graphic (.eps) it seems that matlab is exporting the figure in an ordered manner (i don't know why), such that the isolines are drawn underneath the surface. First I thought they were not drawn at all, but one can get them back in any vector graphic program by moving them to the front...\n\nAnyway, if the isolines are drawn after the surface, they are on top when exported.\n\n \nI changed that in my code, but it would be nice if i wouldn't have to do that with every new version...\nthanks\nphilipp"
