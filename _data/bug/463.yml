          Currently there are "orphaned" pages (with no links to them), and there are "wanted" pages (with a link, but not the page. Where possible, these have to be fixed. Probably there are a lot of changed page names, which are easy to fix. Furthermore, there are probably missing reference pages which can be added to ft_documentationreference.

          See http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/orphans for an automatic list of problematic wiki pages.

          I think I fixed most of the 'wanted' links that were possible to fix. It turns out that the specest documentation was not in the ft_documentationreference function, so I added it there. This should be visible in tomorrow's update.

          Strangely, for many of the 'wanted' pages, I get zero results when I click the 'backlinks' option. Not sure why this is. Should I follow up on this? If not, the bug can be closed.

          I removed the orphan pages that were clearly obsolete. However, many of them are either reference pages or pages that seem to be in use by people who have the url to them. Therefore, many (harmless) orphans remain.

        thetext: The issue with no backlinks showing up was due to (1) an outdated version of the orphan-checking plugin, and (2) an outdated full-text index. I fixed these, and everything is OK now.
