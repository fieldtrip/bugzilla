          I don't immediately have the answer to the question, so someone with more ICA expertise can feel free to do this :)

          For the FAQ:

          1) Why in general ICA requires demeaning.
          2) That cfg.demean in ft_componentanalysis is performing a per-trial demeaning.


          However, and maybe this does require a code modification, different methods have different defaults or assumptions within them.  I haven't looked at all, but the 2 most common:

          'runica' states that, if data comes from dis-continuous trials, then the mean from each trial should be removed first, prior to input to runica.  In other words, cfg.demean='yes' should be mandatory in combination with 'runica'.

          'fastica' removes the mean as a first step. However, this is performed on the trial-concatenated data. If cfg.demean=yes, then this step does nothing.  If cfg.demean=no, then could end up with some outlier trials nowhere near the mean.

          'pca' it will matter signficantly whether per-trial demean or not.

        thetext: "I've added myself to the CC as this bug is relevant to me for a part of the TMS-EEG tutorial. \n\nFor the FAQ, according to Hyv√§rinen and Oja (http://www.bsp.brain.riken.jp/ICApub/NN00.pdf) demeaning on the entire dataset is done to simplify the ICA. According to them if the mixed signal has zero-mean, you can assume the source has zero-mean as well. This per-channel demeaning is done (in 'runica' and 'fastica') regardless of what the setting for cfg.demean is.\n\nPer-trial demeaning is done to avoid non-physiological components reflecting the mean of the trial. However, this is problematic in the case of trials where your event of interest causes an offset. According to Makeig: \"When the channel means of the input data differ significantly from the baseline means, making the data mean-zero prior to ICA training introduces an 'active' DC (square-wave) component without physiological significance into the ICA decomposition. This problem may may be minimized by appending response epochs without baseline offsets to the input data (example: responses to standard stimuli appended to responses to target stimuli containing large monophasic late waves).\" - http://sccn.ucsd.edu/~scott/tutorial/icafaq.html."
