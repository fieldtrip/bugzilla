          With the current fieldtrip version I cannot reproduce it, but get another error message

          >> ft_electroderealign(cfg)

          With the fieldtrip version included in the latest EEGLAB I can reproduce it

        thetext: "as a side note: in revision r1093 the cfg.method was cleaned up and a cfg.warp was added (for method=template),  cfg.method=realignfiducial is now fiducial, backward compatibility support is in place in the current version. \n\nThe error in the current version is matlab version specific and has to do with adding a field to a structure. I have fixed that using a simple workaround (and will commit soon)\n\nThere was an error in the handling of the backward compatibility of the cfg-options with checkconfig:  renamed was used instead of renamedval. Fixed\n\nI committed the changes, the latest revision (r1926) now seems to work correctly on the input provided by Arno."
