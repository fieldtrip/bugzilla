          imagine a user function printing to stderr
          that will show up in the *.eXXXX file and hence caught as execution error, causing qsubcellfun to abort

          PS this was observed by Stephen, although the stderr message was from java and not from own code. Nevertheless, the actual job (after diagnosing) turned out to be completed properly.

          A similar problem happens if the MATLAB startup script prints something to stderr. This happens with our matlab2009a installation.
