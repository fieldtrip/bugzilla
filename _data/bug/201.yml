        thetext: In ft_preprocessing the default for the median filter is set (to 9), but in  ft_preproc_medianfilter the default is set as well (to 25). It's not a real problem, since the default is not reset by ft_preproc_medianfilter, but it is a bit inconsistent. Better would be to have them the same, but what would be the better default to use? 9 or 25?

        thetext: I think that ft_preproc_medianfilter should not have a default. It is something the experienced user (at the level of preproc) should be forced to think about.

        thetext: I replaced the default of 25 by an explicit error in ft_preproc_medianfilter. This fixes and closes the bug
