        thetext: "Hi Andrea,\n\nSorry for this late update, but we were still getting used to our new bug management system, and some bugs were not being worked on. I picked up this bug, and it should be fixed now. It was actually fixed a few days ago (so it's already in our latest ftp-versions), but our bugzilla server was experiencing problems. Cfg.avgoverchan should function now, and it works with the test data you gave me. \n\nCould you test it for your self on some other data as well? If it looks fixed, could you then change the status of the bug to 'verified'? \n\nThanks again for reporting it and for providing a clear description with some test-data!\n\nBest,\nRoemer"
