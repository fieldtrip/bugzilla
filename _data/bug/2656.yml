        thetext: "First off, I would like to express my thanks to the people who created, and maintain, this toolbox. As a new phd student within the field, it is a godsend and it seems great! However, I think I encountered a bug. I am no computer wiz, so I may well be overlooking something obvious, but here is what happens on my computer:\n\nI followed the TMS-EEG tutorial on your site, and after getting approximateyl half way, I am asked to look for non-TMS related artifacts to exclude. To do this, I need to plot the non-timelocked ICA components, and the following code is suggested:\n\ncfg          = [];\ncfg.layout   = 'easycapM10';\ncfg.viewmode = 'component'; % Mode specifically suited to browse through ICA data\nft_databrowser(cfg, comp_tms);\n\ncomp_tms above is a file saved from earlier, containing the ICA analysis data in a .mat file. Running this code led to \"an internal problem\" and matlab \"needs to close\". This happened first after going through the entire tutorial, but when I run the above code (alone), only having 'comp_tms' loaded in my workspace, I still get the same error message. \n\nHopefully this is just some minor thing, and likely it is me doing something wrong, but it would be great if it was fixable, as the tutorial so far was great!\n\n\nThank you for reading the report. \nBest regards,\nBjørn\n\n\nPS. I run a 64 bit windows, and matlab 2013b"

There is some unfortunate issue... see here:\nhttp://mailman.science.ru.nl/pipermail/fieldtrip/2014-May/007909.html (click on \"next message\" so read the whole conversation. The Mathworks team helped and apparently it's a combination of OS, graphics card and Matlab specific settings. Martine (see link) solved it by adding \n\n  set(gcf,'renderer','painters');\n\nbefore line 242 in the function ft_plot_topo\n\nBest,\nJörn"
