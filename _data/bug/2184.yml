        thetext: "Could we settle on defining method names always lowercase and convert to lower case if the user specifies them with upper case? \n\nI just bumped into an error in ft_checkconfig, line 279, that creates a subcfg with switch subname. However, a switch-statement is case-sensitive so e.g. ft_sourceanalysis with cfg.method = 'LCMV' to crashes with:\n\nError using ft_checkconfig (line 437)\nunexpected name of the subfunction\n\nWhen defining cfg.method = 'lcmv' instead it works fine.\n\nThe error message I got is really unspecific, a FT beginner might get totally confused by this. Alternatively, the error message might be extended and hint to case sensitivity."

          I don't think that we should be modifying the users configuration, unless we know that it has to be updated to reflect changes in the code which we introduced ourselves. We do not want to take the responsibility out of the users hands.

          However, in this case I do see the convention of spelling the abbreviations in uppercase and our use of them in lower case. I suggest to add "ft_checkconfig renamed LCMV into lcmv" at the beginning of ft_sourceanalysis.

        thetext: isn't that the case for all methods of ft_sourceanalysis, because they are abbreviations? If so, then it would be easier to make cfg.method = lower(cfg.method) rather than have a bunch of ft_checkconfig renamed statements

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
