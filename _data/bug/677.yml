          Lilla, what software did you use to generate your SVG file? I think it is a compressed SVG file, or "SVGZ" file. Our SVG plugin only supports non-compressed SVG files at present. I could extend the plugin to also support compressed files, but I think it's easier to just only use non-compressed ones. I re-exported your image using Adobe Illustrator, and it works.

          The filesize did get quite large, though (>500 kB). This is probably due to something weird I noticed in your file: the blue rectangles are composed of very many tiny squares, almost as if it has been generated from a pixel image, where every pixel was converted to a separate vector square.

          If you recreate the image (including the blue rectangles) in Illustrator, everything should be fine.
