          minperlength maxperlength

          When I want to do a timelock analysis, I get the following error :

          Error using ft_timelockanalysis (line 199)
          data has variable trial lengths, you specified not to accept that !

          Even though my trials have exactly the same length.

          I included the 2 variables minperlength and maxperlength which are causing the problem at line 199.

          It seems the difference is of 0.00000000000002 seconds, which is quite surprising since that is way below my time resolution.

          I uploaded a .mat file at the following address :

          http://www.sendspace.com/file/uk1nqw

          The file is 36MB. I tried to use only a few trials.

          Please let me know if I can be of any further help.

          The following code solves the problem by making the time axes identical again. However, this does not work in case the time axes are shifted relative to each other (i.e. variable trial duration and onset or offset).

          begtime = zeros(1, length(data.time));
          endtime = zeros(1, length(data.time));
          numsample = zeros(1, length(data.time));
          for i=1:length(data.time)
            begtime(i) = data.time{i}(1);
            endtime(i) = data.time{i}(end);
            numsample(i) = length(data.time{i});
          end

          if ~isfield(data, 'fsample')
            fsample = 1/mean(diff(data.time{1}));
          else
            fsample = data.fsample;
          end


          % compute the differences over trials and the tolerance
          tolerance     = 0.1*(1/fsample);
          begdifference = abs(begtime-begtime(1));
          enddifference = abs(endtime-endtime(1));

          % check whether they are identical, or close to identical
          begidentical  = all(begdifference==0);
          endidentical  = all(enddifference==0);
          begsimilar    = all(begdifference < tolerance);
          endsimilar    = all(enddifference < tolerance);

          if false && ~begidentical && begsimilar
            warning('correcting small numerical inaccuracy of %g seconds in the time axes', max(begdifference));
            for i=1:length(data.time)
              data.time{i} = begtime(1) + ((1:numsample(i)) - 1)/fsample;
            end
          elseif false && ~endidentical && endsimilar
            warning('correcting small numerical inaccuracy of %g seconds in the time axes', max(enddifference));
            for i=1:length(data.time)
              data.time{i} = endtime(1) + ((1:numsample(i)) - numsample(i))/fsample;
            end
          end

          I have updated to the latest version and I still have the problem, although minperlength and maxperlength seem equal this time... See the attached datafile :

          Apologies for the large file size.

          I cleaned up my bugzilla list by changing the status from resolved (either fixed or wontfix) into closed. If you don't agree, please reopen the bug.
