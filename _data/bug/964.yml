        thetext: "Hi Cristiano, \nI was about to fix this as Elli suggested (below), and then saw you commented out the line with some other changes today.   Does it not crash as reported on the main Mailing list with the line out so that mri.seg doesn't get created?\n-Johanna\n\n\nHello Johanna -\n\nI'm moving this conversation to dev, since it's primarily a bugfix discussion. In the fix you posted, the `if` statement has at least one problem with it:\n\n   ... && (~isfield(cfg,'tissue') || ...\n\nThe field cfg.tissue is always going to exist, becaues of ft_prepare_mesh (line 70):\n\n   if ~isfield(cfg, 'tissue'),          cfg.tissue = [];            end\n\nYou probably want to use ~empty(cfg.tissue) or something similar.\n\nElli"

          Do note that it should be `isempty(...)`; there's no `empty` function.

          I can verify that the mri.seg does not get created, as that's what caused this problem for me.

          I made a tentative patch:

          @ Cristiano please fix the code as soon as possible. Most likely some code needs to be rewritten for a logical flow of conditional statements.
