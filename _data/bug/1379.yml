          Maybe this will be fixed with a new ft_sourceanalysis, but it was recently pointed out to me by Simon Hanslmayr that .pow is based on the ERP and not all the trials, even if the timelock structure you enter has trials as well as avg.  The only way around this is to set cfg.rawtrial='yes' (a simple thing for the user to do) but then you get all the trials saved out the in .pow as well (which should be controlled by cfg.keeptrials I would think).

          So, even if the filter was correctly computed based on the average of the covariances (rather covariance of the average) by calling ft_sourceanalysis a first time with keepfilter='yes', then the second call to ft_sourceanalysis to apply this filter doesn't give the 'expected' (I would assume default) output.

          Suggestion: if cfg.grid.filter exists, and if timelock.trial exists, then force cfg.rawtrial to equal 'yes' by default.

        thetext: for the meantime (whilst waiting on more major changes to ft_sourceanalysis), update the documentation of this behaviour.
