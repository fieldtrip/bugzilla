          After source statistics cfg.previous can be very large ~7GB slowing down matlab's workspace managing. Display the stat output variable can take a minute in some cases. Robert believes that the large number of .previous field can fragment matlab's memory, making variable manipulations highly unefficient.

          As cfg is very large, a cfg sample is saved in home/common/4robert folder
