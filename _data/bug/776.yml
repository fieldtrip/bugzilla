          The plot2svg toolbox works: it generates .svg files from matlab plots. However, it requires that plots are created as 'v6' figures, a matlab option which has long been deprecated and will be removed in the future. Furthermore, although the export works, it does not offer any advantages to exporting as .eps or .pdf, I think, and opening the generated file in Illustrator takes a long time (in the case of a 151-channel multiplot-TFR).

          I am not quite sure what the intention of this bug was. Integrating the toolbox into fieldtrip is probably a bad idea. If people want to generate svg figures directly from matlab, they can always download the toolbox separately.

          The page http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/documentation_guidelines states "Figures from MATLAB should preferably be exported in the PNG format."

          Is that then still the preferred guideline?

          I would say yes, since we will not want to edit exported Matlab graphics directly. I have updated the documentation guidelines on figures to reflect this, and added a description of how people should proceed if they really want matlab figures saved as SVG, in the case where a vector-editable file is desired.

          I'll leave it to you to close the bug, or of course reassign it to me if I can still be of any use :)
