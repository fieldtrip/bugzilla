        thetext: I don't think this is ever going to happen. GLMs and contrasts are just too flexible for us to provide an accessible level of documentation to go with it. Supporting the users with ft_statfun_glm therefore would be too much of a burden. If people want it, they can make their own.

        thetext: JM had made a version and shared it with me, and I used it happily.  I modified it slightly.   I've attached it here (for someone to use/find in future; hopefully that's ok with JM!!) but I understand if it seems too much work to support.
