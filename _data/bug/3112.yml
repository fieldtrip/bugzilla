          We also did this tutorial in Nijmegen and I cannot remember any issues with it, also not towards the end. That may suggest it to be a user error (e.g. having done something inconsistent with the tutorial early on).

          @JM, did you notice any issues with this tutorial?

        thetext: No I didn't. Cris, could you upload a figure? By the way, we did the 'normal' connectivity tutorial, not the extended one. Are they different?

          Sure, you can find them here (last 2 pictures won't be replicated):

          Issue confirmed.

          Diagnostics performed.

          Verdict: the virtual channel positions were inputted in 'cm' (in a 2-dipole grid, without a specified unit), whereas the volume conduction model was specified in 'mm'. The automatic unit detection probably did not work well on the 'grid' and caused the incorrect positions to be used.

          I have updated the test-function to quickly run all code in the tutorial (the virtual channel stuff was not there), and will update the tutorial documentation with code that produces reproducible results.
