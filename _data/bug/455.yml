          ... because ft_databrowser should by now do most (if not all) of what ft_componentbrowser can do.

          If ft_databrowser is sufficiently complete, we should remove compoenntbrowser to avoid confusion and clarify documentation.

          I see no reason why ft_componentbrowser should be removed or why/how ft_databrowser can take over the function of the componentbrowser. ft_componentbrowser makes a topoplot of (independent) components and plots that next to the timeline of that component. You can browse through trials and components.
          In contrast the databrowser just plots the timeline data without the topographic distribution, which is, however, crucial when dealing with independent components. Using the databrowser to plot components seems more like an abuse of that function to me.

          Is there anything I am missing here?

          aha, I see, sorry for the last comment - it *is* possible to plot topos when using 'component' as viewmode
          I take this one and make databrowser have similar features/possibilities than componentbrowser

          I think I made ft_databrowser have the same features as ft_componentbrowser and also comparable speed - could you please check (I just started using the componentbrowser)

          If I hear no complaints, I'll update the wiki and delete the file from svn by the end of next week
