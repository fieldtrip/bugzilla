          This seems a duplicate problem of bug 2470

          Thanks Craig,
          We have noticed some issues with custom parameters for ft_freqstatistics indeed. Your debugging efforts are received with appreciation. I hope to get to this soon.

          bash-4.1$ svn commit -m "enhancement - allow for arbitrary fieldnames to serve as parameter: changed call to ft_selectdata_old into ft_selectdata_new" ft_freqstatistics.m test/test_bug2502.m
          Sending        ft_freqstatistics.m
          Adding         test/test_bug2502.m
          Transmitting file data ..
          Committed revision 9298.

          I changed the code in ft_freqstatistics to use ft_selectdata with a cfg; this means that it now uses ft_selectdata_new, which does not have a call to seloverdim/dimlength. Problem seems solved. Can you confirm?
