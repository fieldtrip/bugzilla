        thetext: "Hi\nIt has been a while I've noticed a strange behaviour when I try to toggle between trials and/or channels in the channel plotting mode of the data browser.\n\nFor example, when I visualize the first 10 channels of N, I want to page through the trials and then down to the next set of 10 channels, but at some point the viewer toggles back to the first 10 channels. Moreover sometimes the label of the trials (the 'title') is not updated in time, so it is difficult to know in which trial i'm looking into.\n\nI think this has to do with the visualization of the layouts (which btw now appear only as 1/4 of the circular MEG shape ...) that uses mem resources of the PC.\n\nFinally, upon closure of the browser, if all the layouts havent been plotted/updated, a figure re-opens and plots the resting topographies. \n\nI hope we can fix at least some part of it soon.\n\nCristiano"

          Hi Cristiano, you know the drill: could you upload some data so that we can reproduce?

          What is the operating system you are using, matlab version, FT-version etc.

          Hey Cris,
          I don't seem to be able to replicate what you describe. I made some changes last week that drastically decreases the time required for doing the topoplots (and corrected how they were displayed for ctf151 and eeg 1020), so maybe that fixed what you describe? Also, you say channels, but I assume you are referring to components? Setting it to 'worksforme' just to remember that, well, it worked for me :p
