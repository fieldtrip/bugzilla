          haha, small thing ;) great that the filesep in windows is \, which is even greater when working with regular expressions :) took a few minutes to figure out that this is another windows problem

          ftPath = fileparts(mfilename('fullpath')); % get path, strip away 'ft_defaults'
          ftPath = strrep(ftPath, '\', '\\');
          if isempty(regexp(path, [ftPath pathsep '|' ftPath '$'], 'once'))
            warning('FieldTrip is not yet on your MATLAB path, adding %s', ftPath);
            addpath(ftPath);
          end
