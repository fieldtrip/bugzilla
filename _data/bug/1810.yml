        thetext: An initial check reveals a mismatch between the output from timelockanalysis on stored raw data, and the stored (already) timelocked data.

        thetext: "In one particular case (k=6), it pertains to a mismatch between the grad.chanunit fields of a bti148 MEG dataset.\n\ni.e. data.grad.chanunit contains 'unknown's\nwhereas datanew.grad.chanunit contains 'T's\n\nIn another case (k=7), there's an additional field in datanew, namely 'type' (= 'bti248'). Also here a similar mismatch between the chanunit fields is present. Additionally, the chanpos fields are dissimilar. \n\nIn summary, it seems test datasets get outdated due to newer implementations of functions. This needs decision on a general strategy as similar problems have been reported for other functionalities (e.g. test_ft_componentanalysis?)"

        thetext: fixed, presumably since the recent bugbinge (nov 2012) when all 'template' files in testdata were updated.
