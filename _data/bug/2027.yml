          Dear all,

           I am trying to read MEG 4D files with Fieldtrip version 20130226 using ft_preprocessing file with a preselection of MEG channels ( 'MEG' or a cell array of channel names, here is MEG_LABEL) but the output
           data contains only 152 channels while I have 248 channels... I tried the same code with Fieldtrip version 20121015, and I get everything properly (i.e. 248 channels)
           Following the script I am running :


          > cfg = [];
          > cfg.dataset = 'c,rfDC';
          > cfg.trialdef.eventtype  = 'TRIGGER';
          > cfg.trialdef.eventvalue  = 2;
          > cfg.trialdef.prestim    = 1;
          > cfg.trialdef.poststim    = 2;
          > [cfg] = ft_definetrial(cfg);
          >
          > % cfg.channel =  'MEG';
          > cfg.channel = MEG_LABEL;
          > cfg.continous = 'yes';
          > data_2 = ft_preprocessing (cfg)

          I attached MEG_LABEL.MAT/4D MEG file/corresponding config file.
          Thanks a lot for your help

          Best,

          Sophie

          Hi Sophie,

          The file is quite big. We would like to create a repository of small files that we can keep for quality tests etc. Would it be possible to upload one of the 'COH' files, rather than the c,rfDC file?

          Thanks Sophie.

          I could confirm your bug. I think it is a low-level issue with reading the header of the data.
          I made some changes a while ago, which I thought were an improvement. Apparently, it broke things for the Marseille system (but worked for Glasgow and St. Louis).

          There is an issue in read_4d_hdr, where the number of channels in the hdr.label field is incorrect.

          Sophie, do you happen to have MEG sensors that are called 'mXXX' where XXX is a conventional 10-20 EEG electrode label?

          If so, this could be the cause of your problem.

          To speak with the famous Uderzo and Goscinny: 'ils sont fous, ces Gaulois...'. ;-)

          OK, well the 4D neuroimaging dataformat is a bit clunky in terms of the information that is stored in the header. Actually, as far as I remember, there are two locations where information with respect to the channels is stored: the config file (which is site specific, not file specific) and in the header of the file (i.e. a part of the binary file (e.g. c,rfDC)). The generic channel names A1-A248 are probably stored in one location, whereas user-specified (could be site-specific) are stored somewhere else. Most of the time, these labels match, but apparently not for the Marseille system. One of the most recent changes probably assumes MEG channels always to start with 'A'

          Hi Sophie. I fixed it now in the following way.

          All MEG channels are again named A1-A248, so the specification with mXX is lost again.

          If this is OK with you guys, I would stick to this, because the sensor-array definition relies on the MEG channel labels to be A1-A248.

          Could you update and test it? I believe that you can nowadays update your local copy of FieldTrip with the ft_version function. Check the help of this function how it can be used.

          oops -- spoke too soon. actually just tried the latest svn update on some Konstanz data and it (mostly) works for me. however, channel selection seems broken -- i.e., defining cfg.channel = {'MEG'}  still loads in all channels (including reference, EEG/EOG/ECG, trigger, etc.) with the development version. But this behaves as expected with my own modification.

          cheers,

          Dear Jan-Mathijs and Sophie, (cc Tzvetan from Konstanz and Stefan from Erlangen)

          I'm not sure if the bugzilla regarding 4D MEG issues has been filed yet, but I wasn't able to find it. Anyway -- I just wanted to point out that 4D/BTi's file format is annoyingly inconsistent between different laboratories. Code that works to read in data for one installation may not work for another. I suggest that we get together some short datasets from a few different 4D sites so that we can ensure that any updates don't break the import for another lab.

          FYI, I believe the current development version doesn't work for Konstanz or Erlangen either. I did hack up a version that works with these installations but I'm afraid it might break somebody else's!

          Cheers,

          Hi Sarang,

          Thanks for your message. I copied your e-mail into this bug, and cc'ed you and Yuval (who happens to have a bugzilla account). I think we should go for a robust solution here.
          In the past, I have requested some test data, in order to test the extraction of EEG-electrode related information from the header information. I got feedback from Stefan (no data), but I have some data from Erlangen contributed by Margit Schonherr. Also, Yuval sent me a snippet of data, and we also have test data from Glasgow, Marseille, St.Louis and Konstanz. I think that the Konstanz data has come to us in a processed state (I guess it has passed through pdf2set) so it would be great if you could contribute a small dataset (raw) here.
