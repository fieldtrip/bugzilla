        thetext: "The utilities directory contains these functions:\n\n* offset2time - is now obsolete as implemented as subfunction in the relevant ft_ functions\n\n* fastpower, fasttransformplanar - no function is depending on these it seems. They seem too specific to belong to any of the subdirectories \n\n* megplanar_sincos - is an exact copy of the function in the private dir. Only fasttransformplanar makes a call to it\n\n* online_downsample_* and online_filter - seem relevant functions for MEG realtime purposes, and perhaps truely belong in a directoy called utilities\n\n\nMy suggestion is to remove all functions except the 4 with the online prefixes."

        thetext: "The online filter and downsampler have been integrated in the preproc module as ft_preproc_online_*.m\n\nThe offset2time function has been nested as subfunctions in the relevant functions.\n\nThe remaining functions were not documented according to the guidelines and not being called anywhere outside the utitilties dir. They have, therefore, been removed. \n\nThe utitilies directory is now removed."
