          There are some minor bugs when you install openmmeg, which are easy to address:

          1) If you haven't install openmmeg, the matlab native browser opens openmmeg website using web('http://openmeeg.gforge.inria.fr');,  but the problem is that it cannot open https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=435 when you click on Downloads in the openmeeg web page. Therefore, it is better to open the system web browser rather than Matlab native web browser.


          2) In the following web page:

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_can_i_use_openmeeg_for_forward_modelling

          -Please explain that there are two ways of installation, since I thought I have to do both.

          - The second way of installation is using an rpm file OpenMEEG-2.0-0.x86_64.rpm. But I couldn't find this file in the openmeeg website, please clarify where it is.

          - In the first way of installation, please write the following lines in a different font or make them a bit more different:

          export PATH=$PATH:openmeeg_folder/bin
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:openmeeg_folder/lib

          3) There is an example file for calculation of MEG lead-field in the /external/openmeeg/, I think you may remove this for now, since it doesn't work.

          4) You have done a great job to include BEM models for EEG data from different packages, it would be very nice to at least openmeeg using single shell for MEG application as well. As you are aware, these methods are classical and well-established solutions to the differential equations, and MNE and Brainstorm also (which uses openmeeg) are using them.

        thetext: "To move this forward:\n\n@Hamid: \n\nPlease update the webpage according to your suggestions.\n\n@ point 1): you can add a statement that following the download link through Matlab's native browser does not work (did you check whether this depends on the Matlab version?) Either way, this is not a FieldTrip problem, and is not something that we can address.\n\n@ point 2): I think you can easily address these yourself by changing the corresponding wiki-page. If you are insecure about this, just let one of the FT-team read along once you made the changes.\n\n@ point 3): Please provide a testscript that demonstrates that it does not work.\n\n@ point 4): If you already have an implementation, please share it with us, so that we can move the code forward."

        thetext: OK, Hamid, I think it would be great if you contribute to the improvement of the documentation if possible. I noticed that you handed back the responsibility of this bug to the team (which essentially means that nobody feels responsible for it). As a consequence, I think this one will not be solved any time soon, which is a pity. Any small improvements to the wiki by external users are greatly appreciated. Since you are in the best position to do so, I assigned this one to you to keep this bug alive and move it forward. At the moment the team is suffering from an overload of bugs (particularly the unassigned ones), so if you don't take this one on your shoulders, nobody probably will. I think the time you spent on this issue so far may have been well spent from your point of view (because it seems you already have the solution), the community will greatly benefit from an additional 15 minutes of your time.
