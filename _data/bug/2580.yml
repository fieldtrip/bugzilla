          it will indeed be related to my change of today related to bug #2478. However, I don't understand why "abort" would not exist. The boolean variable is created here

          https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/diff?spec=svn9520&r=9520&format=side&path=/trunk/utilities/private/ft_preamble_init.m

          which is in the same revision.

          @Ayelet, could you check your copy of ft_preamble_init? Could you set a breakpoint in ft_preamble_init and see what goes on?

          Starting from a completely empty path, and adding only the main fieldtrip folder, I cannot reproduce the problem. The ft_defaults does its work properly and sets up the path such that ft_preamble_init can be found

          I wonder whether it is a problem due to updating the fieldtrip code on disk without restarting matlab. In that case I could imagine that the change in ft_preamble_init would not be noticed by matlab and that hence the "abort" variable not being set.

          If this were the case, it would potentially only happen once around the update of the code on disk

          @Ayelet, are you still able to reproduce the problem?

          Hi All,

          I am still able to reproduce the problem. I also tried restarting matlab, clearing my path, leaving only the main ft folder in -- running ft_defaults.

          the problem persists.

          As for breaking at ft_preamble_init:
          when I step into this function - it actually does very little

          the first line: if nargin==0
          is false
          do it jumps right out of it.

          here is the conditional that is ft_preamble_help in title, but ft_preamble_init in file name - just in case:

          if nargin==0
            stack = dbstack('-completenames');
            % stack(1) is this script
            % stack(2) is the calling ft_postamble function
            % stack(3) is the main FieldTrip function that we are interested in
            stack = stack(3);
            help(stack.name);
            % throw the error as if it happened in the original function
            msg.message     = 'This function requires one or multiple input arguments, please refer to the documentation above';
            msg.identifier  = '';
            msg.stack       = stack;
            error(msg);
          end

          looking forward to a work around!
          best,
          Ayelet

          Hi Ayelet,

          It seems to me that you have an old ft_preamble_init.m, since in the change involving abort I also fixed the function name and help. Can you compare it with
          https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/browse/trunk/utilities/private/ft_preamble_init.m

          The important difference is that there is a second section wher the abort variable is set.

          Hi Robert,

          our file is not the right one.
          here is the ID
          % $Id: ft_preamble_init.m 8241 2013-06-12 13:38:54Z jorhor $

          and here is the function pasted:


          if nargin==0
            stack = dbstack('-completenames');
            % stack(1) is this script
            % stack(2) is the calling ft_postamble function
            % stack(3) is the main FieldTrip function that we are interested in
            stack = stack(3);
            help(stack.name);
            % throw the error as if it happened in the original function
            msg.message     = 'This function requires one or multiple input arguments, please refer to the documentation above';
            msg.identifier  = '';
            msg.stack       = stack;
            error(msg);
          end


          how do I go about repairing this situation?
          I am using the fieldtrip version sitting on the cluster /opt/fieldtrip
          at this point - you might know better than I would what the protocol for updates of this version is.

          Let me know how you think I should address this.

          Hi Ayelet,

          Good to hear that it is not some magical difference between MATLAB versions, but just a n update problem.

          When and where did you get the fieldtrip version from that you are using? Is someone else in charge of updating it, i.e. is it on a network share? If so, please discuss with that person. Otherwise just get the latest version (zip file) from our FTP server.

          Robert
