          @Irina

          could you attach (or better send through home/common because of privacy) the input MRI and cfg on which it fails? That will help in debugging and ensuring that the problem (when fixed) does not re-surface in the future.

          I put a mat-file with an MRI image in Fieldtrip format into common/temporary/4Bugzilla

          Here is the code:

          load segmentedS2 struct_reslice

          cfg = [];
          cfg.coordsys  = 'ctf';
          struct_segment = ft_volumesegment(cfg, struct_reslice);

          thanks. I have copied the test data to

          error reproduced. it could be caused by the fact that the bounding box around the anatomical does not fully encapsulate the whole head. If I take a resliced MRI, in which this is the case, i.e. the head is more centered in the image, the affine registration works just fine.
          It could have another cause though, but this would be my first guess.

          Hi Irinia,

          Could you also upload the original MRI so that I can see why the reslicing does not work appropriately?

          Found it. After reslicing the anatomical volume contains NaNs. This is something SPM cannot handle.
          I suggest to fix this in ft_volumereslice, and to build in a check in align_ctf2spm to convert the NaNs to 0.
          Also, I will build a try catch around the spm based coregistration, so that the function will not crash, but just provides the initial (and sometimes inaccurate) coregistration matrix.

          @Robert: agreed?

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #6)\n\nI agree with the 0s instead of NaNs (at both locations, i.e. when creating and\nalso when using it). Is it an idea to implement this through ft_checkdata (and\ncode+documentation it in ft_datatype_volume), i.e. there we can state that the\nanatomy is not allowed to contain NaNs? \n\nI am not sure what the value is of getting the initial coregistration matrix in\ncase SPM fails.

          well, the initial coregistration matrix is the one which was outputted prior to my changes last week. these have been of good enough value to the DCCN anatomicals so far. I am not sure whether I could imagine scenarios where the approximate coregistration (if not accurate enough to begin with) is sufficient.

          I would be happy to then stick to the SPM error.

          Do we have an accord?
