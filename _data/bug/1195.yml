          Mclust is a nice matlab utility that is the common program for spike-sorting.
          It would be nice if data in spike-format can be directly read in by MClust, and on the other hand, it would be nice if we can use data in the MClust format (usually object-oriented with ts object) can be read in using the fieldtrip spike functions

          It doesn't seem as if there's much incentive in moving this forward.
          Changing status for now. Feel free to re-open if there's somebody who wants to push this.
