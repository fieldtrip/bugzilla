I hope this helps anyway.\n\nI have used SPM12 quite a bit in the ft pipelines I developed. In the last iteration I am using Dartel-based normalization of native-space contrasts computed in native grids. \n\nHere I am giving the procedures for doing MNI grids based on the new segmentation in SPM, and also the procedures for doing the Dartel-based analysis (big picture approach).\n\nThe code below for calling SPM routines is based on the batch system (need to dig the actual functions, and quite a few must be common to SPM8).\n\n1.

Note, this also uses a smoothing of the dartel-normalized images, which boosts SNR further than what already done by the improved Dartel-based alignment of anatomies. We have two options here.\n\n10.a. we Dartel-normalize native-space stuff then smooth\n\nbatch.spm.tools.dartel.crt_warped %dartel normalize\nTHEN\nbatch.spm.spatial.smooth %smooth\n\n10.b. directly normalize to MNI (includes a smoothing step):\n\nbatch.spm.tools.dartel.mni_norm\n\nThe SPM community prefers 10.a. Note that with this option the Dartel normalization is slower than with option 10.b. Also, 10.a. produces volumes with the same resolution of the Dartel template, which should be overkill for MEG. Ideally, one would resample the output of 10.a. to a target resolution and find out how 10.a. can be sped up."

          :-)

          Perhaps a large chunk of the dartel functionality should extend ft_prepare_headmodel rather than ft_volumesegment. In ft_prepare_headmodel, one could also include the atlas-based approach for eliminating structures based on labels in MNI atlases.

          For the dartel-based pipeline, ft_volumesegment should just include the new SPM12 default segmentation as an option (should be "unified segmentation", called "new segmentation" in SPM8).

          One additional function might also be required - ft_darteltemplate - to put together information from different experiment participants and prepare the dartel template.

          The dartel-based normalization could finally extend ft_volumenormalise

          In the grand scheme, we should also consider how this should be integrated with the stats functions. One thought about this is that the quite high overhead for dartel normalisation might make permutation-based group analyses quite difficult (I am sticking to parametric stats, for the moment). It should be possible to bring down this overhead through code hacking.

          Check e.g., slide 28 of https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/teaching/SPM2016/Ridgway2016_SPMZurich_VBM.pdf to have a glimpse of the difference between traditional group-level normalization (template 0), and dartel-based normalization (template 6).

          What do you think?

          Hi gents,

          Any idea what the timeline of this endeavor may be? Working with iEEG data, normalization of electrode positions remains an ongoing battle. The sample sizes are typically small and the atlases play an important role for selecting electrodes/areas of interest, hence it matters whether each electrode ends up. Currently, nonlinear warping with the default settings of spm8 (in ft_volumenormalize) doesnt provide reliable results, in worst case scenarios depth electrodes ending up outside the brain.

          We're currently in the process of wrapping and writing up an iEEG pipeline, in which we illustrate and cite the normalization techniques currently supported by fieldtrip through spm. It would be great if we could use this occasion to demonstrate and advertise the dartel technique. If it could be implemented in the coming few weeks or so, I could still add it.

          Best,
          Arjen

          I don't think it is realistic that it will be added smoothly anytime soon.

          I have managed to strip the ugly example code in spm (getting rid of the batch manager etc), to get a DARTEL based normalization. Yet I am not sure so much what the advantage of this is beyond the most recent improvement (using the new-style segmentation). Bruno clearly has a good opinion about the benefits for his projects (and has hands on experience), but the extent to which this generalizes to the general FT-population, and  whether it is worth the hassle is still unclear to me.

        thetext: These things indeed require a lot of fiddling, judging from my limited experiences with getting SPM12's affreg implemented. At the same time, it may be worth the effort if dartel produces reliable results. What's your take on how dartel stacks up to the other coreg procedures out there, Bruno?

        thetext: "Created attachment 840\nDartel iterations\n\nHi,\n\nI find going a Dartel-based pipeline much preferable for multiple reasons:\n\n1. as you can see from the attached image, the spatial specificity of the anatomical template is much higher, implying better realignment of individuals, and more accurate anatomical labeling of group results (e.g., it seems to be the current SPM method of choice for VBM). One could reasonably object to these being important for MEG, given the high spatial blur of sources. This question is obviously empirical. See point 3.\n\n2. Dartel MEG source analyses rely on projection grids that are isotropic in native space but not in group space. The traditional FT approach relies on projection grids that are isotropic in group space but not in native space. This difference is critical for MVPA searchlight analyses, perhaps even more so for the multimodal fMRI/MEG project for which I developed the Dartel pipeline. Indeed, few reviewers would likely accept MVPA of fMRI on non-isotropic native \"grids\".\n\n3. The Dartel MEG pipeline relies on spatial smoothing of native-space \"contrast\" maps (e.g., MEG power, or RSA correlations in my case). I might be wrong, but with the MNI grid approach smoothing is usually not implemented. Smoothing of single subject maps prior to group analysis acknowledges imperfections in the normalizations. More importantly, spatial blur is reasonably expected to boost the power of group analyses. This corresponds to my experience. Obviously, what I am saying is that Dartel is expected to be beneficial because it improves the anatomical specificity of the template while decreasing that of functional results ;-)\n\nThe Dartel pipeline is obviously much more involved and requires more steps than the traditional MNI pipeline. I would love to have the time right now to work on including it in the FT distribution, but at the moment I can't do much more than sharing commented code snippets. \n\nIt would probably be a good idea to compare common statistics such as MEG power in the two pipelines before investing more time on this.

This anatomical precision would certainly be important for mapping over iEEG data, if not just for MEG. It's not clear to me how or why the dartel technique affords, or maybe causes, these anatomically more realistic template brains. Forgive my ignorance in this matter, but does the '6th iteration' here also imply that dartel is somehow also more efficient at it than other techniques?\n\n- Another recent observation with iEEG data (looking at single-subject electrode locations seems a good way for exposing shortcomings) is that electrodes sometimes are entirely off in the template brains. I can't really tell whether that is due to the template used (it seems to matter in some instances) or the algorithm itself. What is an issue though is that the quality of the scans are occasionally so-so, for instance in the case of a 'post-implant scan' (i.e. with electrode-related noise) or a contrast scan. Do you happen to have any idea whether dartel also disproportionally outperforms other techniques with inferior scan quality, or does it maybe become of an issue even?   \n\n\n\"The Dartel pipeline is obviously much more involved and requires more steps than the traditional MNI pipeline.

          It's simply a much better volumetric alignment method that relies on much more complex methods ;-) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17761438

          6th iteration is the 6th iteration of the alignment process. The template on the left was the 0th iteration.

          Dartel can potentially be used to create special templates (e.g., lesions) because it does not rely on external atlases when creating a template truly specific to your group of subjects. Perhaps if you have implant artifacts you can mask out roughly the same problematic region from all anatomicals. There should be similar examples in the  literature/online.

          I have given Jan-Mathijs quite a few commented code snippets. Perhaps you can check them in the coming weeks?
