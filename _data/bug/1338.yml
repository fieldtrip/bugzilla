          Hi guys,

          For those that are interested I figured out the problem. Somewhere in the process of running component analysis and then component rejection, fieldtrip was taking .chanpos and .chanori in my .grad field and replacing all the values with NaNs. I fixed the problem by adding cleandata.grad = data.grad just after component rejection. It would be great though, if some one could look at the ft_componentanalysis and ft_rejectcomponent functions and figure out why the grad information is being lost.

          Thanks!
          Keith

          This is intended behaviour.

          Components don't have 'positions', so once you project to component space the position info is lost.
          The only way to get it back, is to use a fresh grad-structure.

        thetext: as far as I understood, Keith rejected components and then went from component-space back to sensor-space. Then, he wanted to interpolate sensors. Since ft_rejectcomponent transforms comp back to sensor-space data there should be sensor positions as well, shouldn't it?

          after writing this, I vaguely remember that we had a discussion about this in one of the FT meetings
          Maybe it should be just be stated somewhere that sensor position information will be removed in componentanalysis...
