        A fundamental feature of spectral analysis (when using tapers to control for spectral leakage) is that the basis functions are not strictly orthogonal. In particular the low frequencies (DC + ) present in the data can as a consequence leak to the whole spectral range. As this may be an unwanted outcome of the spectral analysis, it is generally best to mean subtract/detrend/highpassfilter the time domain data prior to the spectral decomposition.
        After a discussion with Robert we decided not to let the user be responsible for this, but build it into fieldtrip. More specifically, at the level of the low-level specest functions we will implement this as
        'detrend' 0/1/2, which will fit and subtract a 0/1/2 order polynome to the time series. The higher level calling function will set the default (did we agree to let ft_freqanalysis put it to 2?).
        Additionally, we will write some documentation in the form of a FAQ, similar to one already existing FAQ related to the TFR and DC.
