          (In reply to comment #2)

          note that the function won't be called at the moment, as I replaced it with a normal pinv.

        thetext: lmoutrn is generally faster than the mex'ed implementation, once it needs to loop more than ~20 times. At the moment I don't know whether the function is called to test a single point against a single triangle, but in case a point (e.g. electrode) is tested against a set of triangles, it's way faster. Note that at present project_elec is calling both lmoutrn (indirectly for the whole array because it is called from ptriprojn), and lmoutr when the closest point has been identified. Since lmoutr and ptriproj seem to be needed throughout fieldtrip for project_elec only, it may be safe to consider the removal of the mex-files, and to replace the call to lmoutr in project_elec by a call to lmoutrn
