          As far as I can see; these functions have the same functionality. The only thing that may be different is that the nan_XXX throw a warning when dividing by zero.

          To do:
          -make the functionality of nanXXX identical to nan_XXX
          -replace all calls to nan_XXX by calls to nanXXX (this is coincident with standard matlab)
          -remove nan_XXX from the repository
