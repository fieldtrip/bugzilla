          There is a FieldTrip pipeline that creates a cortical mesh (a source) based on anatomical images with the help of FreeSurfer. This pipeline has been written by Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen.
          However, this pipeline is not entirely in "FieldTrip form" yet. Therefore, new FieldTrip functions are necessary.

          I have suggested a list of new functions at
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/minimum_norm_estimate_in_fieldtrip#source_space

          And one more remark:

          The field 'unit' has to be assigned to the created mesh, and these units has to be converted (with ft_convert_units). Maybe this step could be included in one of the new functions.
