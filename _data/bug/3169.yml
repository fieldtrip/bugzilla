        simulate sinusoid and plot the spectrograms with hanning and multitapring methods

        Hello,

        I was trying to figure out the unit of the power in spectrograms. So I made a sinusoid with a certain amplitude and frequency and then plotted the spectrogram with two methods: hanning and multitapering. I expected that power should be close to the squared amplitude of signal but with neither methods I got this!
        So, I suppose there is some kind of normalization going on inside fieldtrip which I do not understand, therefore I can not proceed with other kind of analysis if I do not know what are the values I get from spectrograms.
        I attached the script I used for producing sinusoid and plots.
        By the way, there is another post in the following link which raised the similar issue but unfortunately there was no answer to it:
        https://mailman.science.ru.nl/pipermail/fieldtrip/2015-October/009723.html

        Thank you in advance for clarifying this issue.

        Best, Danial
