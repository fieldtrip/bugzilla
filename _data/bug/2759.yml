          works for some channels, not for others. depends a lot on the viewmode
          every circle has a buttondownfcn responsible for changing the title if the circle is clicked, i.e. this might be a matlab 2014b hg2 thing and there is nothing we can do about it

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
