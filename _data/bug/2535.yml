        thetext: "Hi,\n\nI get a crash when calling ft_apply_montage with ft_megplanar (for several late FT versions). I guess this comes from calling incorrect gradiometer info from the ICA output during ft_apply_montage, but I am not sure.\n\nThis is what happens: \n\nThe following is the gradiometer info of my ft_preprocessing output before I call ft_componentanalysis:\n\ndata.grad = \n\n     balance: [1x1 struct]\n     chanori: [299x3 double]\n     chanpos: [299x3 double]\n    chantype: {299x1 cell}\n    chanunit: {299x1 cell}\n     coilori: [589x3 double]\n     coilpos: [589x3 double]\n    coordsys: 'ctf'\n       label: {299x1 cell}\n         tra: [299x589 double]\n        type: 'ctf275'\n        unit: 'cm'\n\nI add six EEG channels to the ICA causing changes in grad-info of the ICA-output comp:\n\ncomp.grad = \n\n       balance: [1x1 struct]\n       chanori: [305x3 double]\n       chanpos: [305x3 double]\n       coilori: [589x3 double]\n       coilpos: [589x3 double]\n      coordsys: 'ctf'\n         label: {305x1 cell}\n           tra: [305x589 double]\n          unit: 'cm'\n    chanposorg: [299x3 double]\n    chanoriorg: [299x3 double]\n      labelorg: {299x1 cell}\n\n\nAfter calling ft_rejectcomponent using the original data (data_rej = ft_rejectcomponent(cfg, comp, data)), the grad-info gets correctly updated:\n\ndata_rej.grad = \n\n       balance: [1x1 struct]\n       chanori: [305x3 double]\n       chanpos: [305x3 double]\n       coilori: [589x3 double]\n       coilpos: [589x3 double]\n      coordsys: 'ctf'\n         label: {305x1 cell}\n           tra: [305x589 double]\n          type: 'ctf275'\n          unit: 'cm'\n    chanposorg: [299x3 double]\n    chanoriorg: [299x3 double]\n      labelorg: {299x1 cell}\n\nSo far, so good. However, as soon as I call ft_megplanar (prior to ft_freqanalysis) there is a dimension mismatch during calculating sens.tra in ft_apply_montage:\n\n\n   Error using  * \n   Inner matrix dimensions must agree.\n\n   Error in ft_apply_montage (line 220)\n      sens.tra = montage.tra * sens.tra;\n\n   Error in ft_megplanar (line 309)\n  interp.grad = ft_apply_montage(sens, planarmontage, 'balancename', 'planar', 'keepunused', 'yes');\n\nIt seems that montage.tra (569x299 double) contains only the MEG channels, which are selected by ft_apply_montage (as wanted for ft_megplanar), whereas sens.tra (=data_rej.grad.tra,305x589 double) still contains information about the added six EEG channels causing a dimension mismatch during multiplying. I guess, in sens.tra only the MEG channels should be selected as well.\n\nI can circumvent this problem by overwriting data_rej.grad with data.grad (the gradiometer info prior to the ICA), however, shouldn't this also work with the actual output of ft_rejectcomponent? Or am I misunderstanding something?\n\nThanks a lot for your help!\n\nRegards,\nJonathan"

        thetext: I am not sure whether this is still a problem. The code has probably significantly evolved since this has been first submitted, and nobody has followed up on this (including the person who filed the bug). For now, I suggest to close it, but feel free to reopen.
