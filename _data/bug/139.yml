        thetext: "if I do\n\n n = 100;\n peercellfun(@pause, repmat({3}, 1, n) )\n\nin one matlab, and \n\n while(1); peerlist; pause(1); end\n\nin another, I observe  multiple peerslaves switching from idle to zombie. This suggests that smartcpu is triggered simultaneously. Previously I had also observed a race condition between slaves, which caused them to alternate between idle and zombie."

        thetext: this has been resolved by accumulating evidence over multiple calls prior to switching mode. Furthermore, there is now a freeze flag in smartcpu and smartmem, which is used by tcpsocket to prevent the switching of mode and/or memory available while a new job is arriving.
