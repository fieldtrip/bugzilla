        thetext: "exporting channel-level data to EDF and GDF would be useful for interoperability with other software.\n\nft_write_data should export to EDF, with the restrictions that appending does not have to be supported. In case appending is supported, the requirement should be that the input data matrix is casted to int16.\n \nWriting to GDF should be easier. Also here support for appending is not the most important.\n\nBoth EDG and GDF can probably be implemented using BIOSIG (see fieldtrip/external)"

          I also checked in code for writing EDF files without depending on BIOSIG.
          Writes data as int16, with warnings in case round-off errors might occur (original data type != int16), and errors if the scale of the data does not fit in 16-bit integers. No support for appending, yet.
