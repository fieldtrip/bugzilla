          Test script

          I noticed that after ft_prepare_vol_sens electrode locations are wrong and some are projected to the bottom of the head. This didn't happen before on the same example. Please check ASAP as this would completely distort the results.

          I identified the culprit: ptriprojn (called on line 43 of project_elec) returns a signed distance. To get the index to the closest triangle on line 45, one should evaluate the abs(dist).

          I will change this...after today's FT meeting :-).

          Good that the bug was only there for a short time mostly overlapping with holidays. That was exactly the window for it to make it into our Aston workshop version but luckily we only showed MEG examples there ;-) Thanks for the excellent detective work!
