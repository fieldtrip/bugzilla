          One thing I realized at some point is that if you want to simply z-transform you data and (as a programming newbie) use the zscore function for this, you exhaust the Stats Toolbox licenses.

          Simply creating your own function that does the same or manually performing the z-transform in your script circumvents this.

          I mention this since this might be an often-used function of which people don't realize that it is part of the Stats Toolbox - which is in fact ridiculous given its simplicity. I don't know if there are more of these kind of examples, but it sounds like a waste of license money/sneaky trick of the Stats Toolbox developers to me.
