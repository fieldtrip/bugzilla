          Ft_selectdata? **whistling a tune while looking innocently towards the sky**
          Form the top of my head, it would only be chan_freq data and chan_time data, that has been averaged during statistics with the cfg.avgoverfreq and cfg.avgovertime options. So, at the moment I can't think of any other examples than output from freg/timelockstatistics (with avg = yes) causing a crash when trying to plot it with zparam = stat.

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
