The latest version I managed to download was of the 11th of December, but it didnt contain the file nanstd.mexw64 (instead, it contains 'nanstd.mexw32'). \n\nIs there any other way to proceed?\n\nThanks"

          i meant in my prior email the january 11th  version; i now also managed to get the january 13th version; it also lacks the abovementioned file --- is it certainly that in the version of yesterday the file is present??

          thanks

          ok, i just managed downloading the latest version,
          and actually the problem also persists here:
          the nanstd.mexw64 doesnt exist here either (in 'statfun\private\' directory).

          Any suggestions how to proceed and run successfully ft_timelockstatistics?

          thanks

          it should be present in fieldtrip/src/

          you can copy it over to statfun/private.

          no, it's not in SRC either, only the 'nanstd.mexw32' file,
          but when i run the script i receive the error message that it cannot find 'nanstd.mexw64'

        thetext: If the compiled mex filed (which is the nanstd.mexw64) does not exist, fieldtrip should revert to using nanstd.m. So I don't understand why you get the error to begin with.
