        thetext: "Once a slave switches from idle to busy, it knows what the memreq of the job is. This will (per definition) be less than the memavail. \n\nIt is more informative to announce the memreq than the memavail, because that can be displayed as summary in peerlist.  Right now peerlist displays the memavail of the busy slaves."

          instead of using memavail=memreq, there is now an additional structure host->current that is announced. It includes all details.
