          ft_artifact_tms sets the field cfg.artfctdef.tms.method to 'zvalue' is found empty. It seems this field is not used, not in ft_artifact_tms for that matter. The relevant field is cfg.method. In fact, even if cfg.method is set to 'marker' (as is done in the TMS-EEG tutorial), the cfg.artfctdef.tms.method is still set to 'zvalue'. 'zvalue' seems to be appropriate only when strcmpi(cfg.method,'detect'). Anyhow, this is the most trivial of matters, but I felt this field setting could potentially confuse others.

          This 'bug' can be replicated using the TMS-EEG tutorial (or any other data for that matter).

          % Ringing/Step Response artifact
          cfg                         = [];
          cfg.method                  = 'marker'; % The alternative is 'detect' to detect the onset of pulses
          cfg.dataset                 = 'jimher_toolkit_demo_dataset_.eeg';
          cfg.prestim                 = 0.001;     % First time-point of range to exclude
          cfg.poststim                = 0.006;     % Last time-point of range to exclude
          cfg.trialdef.eventtype      = 'Stimulus';
          cfg.trialdef.eventvalue     = {'S  1', 'S  3'};
          cfg_ringing = ft_artifact_tms(cfg);     % Detect TMS artifacts

        thetext: "Hey Lennart,\n\nIf I remember correctly cfg.artfctdef.tms.method is a non-documented option that should not be touched by the user. It is set to 'zvalue' in the case that cfg.method = 'detect', as it is simply a wrapper around ft_artifact_zvalue. However, I see no reason in moving this check to the 'cfg.method' switch a few lines down. \n\nI'll update the code accordingly."

          The option used to be consistent with the other artefact detection functions.

          mac011> grep if.*cfg.artfctdef.*method.*zvalue *.m
          ft_artifact_ecg.m:if ~isfield(cfg.artfctdef.ecg,'method'),   cfg.artfctdef.ecg.method    = 'zvalue';      end
          ft_artifact_ecg.m:if ~strcmp(cfg.artfctdef.ecg.method, 'zvalue'),
          ft_artifact_eog.m:if ~isfield(cfg.artfctdef.eog,'method'),       cfg.artfctdef.eog.method      = 'zvalue'; end
          ft_artifact_eog.m:if ~strcmp(cfg.artfctdef.eog.method, 'zvalue')
          ft_artifact_jump.m:if ~isfield(cfg.artfctdef.jump,'method'),          cfg.artfctdef.jump.method     = 'zvalue';        end
          ft_artifact_jump.m:if ~strcmp(cfg.artfctdef.jump.method, 'zvalue')
          ft_artifact_muscle.m:if ~isfield(cfg.artfctdef.muscle,'method'),       cfg.artfctdef.muscle.method      = 'zvalue';  end
          ft_artifact_muscle.m:if ~strcmp(cfg.artfctdef.muscle.method, 'zvalue')
          ft_artifact_tms.m:if ~isfield(cfg.artfctdef.tms,'method'),            cfg.artfctdef.tms.method        = 'zvalue';  end

          Although I did not look into the various uses, I do think there is a reason for that consistency and that making the tms implementation inconsistent with the others might lead to problems in the future.

          Could you check the others and see whether the same change that you made for tms also applies there?

        thetext: "The reason why all the other ft_artifact_XXX functions have cfg.artfctdef.XXX.method set to 'zvalue' is because all are solely wrappers around ft_artifact_zvalue, which requires that configuration option. ft_artifact_tms, however, either uses ft_definetrial and the TMS markers in the data, or ft_artifact_zvalue to create an artifact matrix with the samples that should be dealt with. Only in the later case, when ft_artifact_tms behaves the same as the other ft_artifact_XXX functions, is cfg.artfctdef.tms.method required. \n\nTo sum up, as soon as ft_artifact_tms is used as any other ft_artifact_xxx function (i.e. if cfg.method='detect'), then cfg.artfctdef.tms.method is set to 'zvalue' and is consistent with the other ft_artifact_XXX functions."

          all clear, thanks
