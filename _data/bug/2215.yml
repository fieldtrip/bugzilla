          Note to all: we should not add test data to fieldtrip/test, but store it in /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test.

          The consequence of having it in the repository (besides the one mentioned by Jim) is that it is added to each and every zip file that people download from the ftp server. We don't want to distribute the test data and we don't want the fieldtrip release to be unnecessary big.

          To give you an idea

          mbp> du -hs test/
          668M    test/

          there is presently 668 MB of stuff in the test directory. The fieldtrip release version is a 200MB zip file.

          It helps quite a bit in the repository

          mbp> du -hs test/
           28M    test/

          But it won't make a difference for the release version, I just downloaded it and saw that the test directory is not in the zip.
