          Hello,
          I think this might be related to Robert's recent change: https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?spec=svn10137&r=10137

          My freq data is:
              powspctrm: [4-D double]
                  label: {63x1 cell}
                   freq: [4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30]
                   time: [1x251 double]
                 dimord: 'subj_chan_freq_time'
                    cfg: [1x1 struct]


          I am running ft_freqstatistics (which ran fine a few weeks ago; I've just svn updated an hour ago) and it crashes:

          Reference to non-existent field 'inside'.

          Error in clusterstat (line 171)
              tmp(cfg.inside) = postailobs;

          Error in ft_statistics_montecarlo (line 358)
            [stat, cfg] = clusterstat(cfg, statrand, statobs);

          Error in ft_freqstatistics (line 190)
              [stat, cfg] = statmethod(cfg, dat, design);


          I think the problem is the recent change in ft_freqstatistics that assigns a cfg.dim which for this data is [63 14 161] (chan_time_freq).

          Then in ft_statistics_montecarlo, there is this line since isfield(cfg,'dim') is true:
                % input data can be reshaped into a 3D volume, use bwlabeln/spm_bwlabel rather than clusterstat
          However is this right to consider it a 3D volume?
          In any case, there is no cfg.inside as it is not a 3D volume.

          Thank you,
          Johanna

          yes, that is my bad. The bug was also detected as an error in test_bug1984_2187.

          I fixed it. The test script test_bug1984_2187 again works. I don't know whether this deals with all possible cases, so please reopen if your case still fails.
