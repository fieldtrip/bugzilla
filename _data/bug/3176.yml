          ft_electroderealign requires the field cfg.headshape.pnt. However, even if this field is present it is moved to .pos in line 271 by calling cfg.headshape = fixpos(cfg.headshape).

          One line later (line 272) ft_electroderealign calls headshape = mesh2edge(cfg.headshape) which refers to the field .pnt, leading to the error:

          ----
          Reference to non-existent field 'pnt'.

          Error in mesh2edge (line 82)
          newbnd.pnt  = bnd.pnt;

          Error in ft_electroderealign (line 272)
              headshape = mesh2edge(cfg.headshape);
          ----

          You can recreate the problem by loading the vol from:
          ftp://ftp.fieldtriptoolbox.org/pub/fieldtrip/tutorial/headmodel_fem/vol.mat

          ...and executing the following code:
          elec          = ft_read_sens('standard_1020.elc');
          cfg           = [];
          cfg.method    = 'interactive';
          cfg.elec      = elec;
          cfg.headshape = vol;
          elec_aligned  = ft_electroderealign(cfg);

        thetext: "The problem occurs because mesh2edge is called from fieldtrip/private. There is another mesh2edge in fieldtrip/forward/private. \n\nThere the line 82\nnewbnd.pnt = bnd.pnt; (fieldtrip/private)\n\n...is replaced by \nbnd = fixpos(bnd);\nnewbnd.pos = bnd.pos; (fieldtrip/forward/private)\n\n...which fixes the problem. Can this be changed also in the fieldtrip/private/mesh2edge?\n\nI don't know if this would break any other functions. If it doesn't here is a pull request making the change:\nhttps://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/210"
