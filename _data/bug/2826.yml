        thetext: "Just got this email from Rodolfo:\n\nHi Eelke,\n \nI have a little question for you. Since yesterday I've trying to run some cluster analyses with ft_freqstatistics but it sends me an error saying that there's a reference to a non existent filed ('inside'). Quite strange as these are sensor level data and I made many analyses with them during the last week. Do you know if something changed in the function? Thanks in advance!\n \nBest,\nRodolfo\n\n@Robert: perhaps something to do with the new source representation? I have not confirmed the bug yet, will try to do so if/when I have time."
