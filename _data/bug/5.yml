        thetext: I replaced ft_freqdescriptives with a new implementation, which allows for frequency and time-selection. Should become available on /home/common/ within the next 15 minutes or so. Please note that this is a totally new implementation and a lot of previously supported functionality is not supported anymore. Please read the function's help for more information.
