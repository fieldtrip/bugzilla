But I might be wrong here.\n\nIt would make sense to consider the EEG and MEG case separately and to approach it from the conceptual level. \n\nFor EEG there is a need for manual/interactive realignment and the need for non-affine transformations (i.e. non-linear fitting of the electrodes to the scalp surface). For EEG you can also imagine it being desirable to click on vitE capsules in an anatomical MRI.\n\nMEG only needs rigid-body transformations. In some cases it involves fitting headshapes to MRI-segmented scalp surfaces, and applying the transform on the MEG coils. It might also make sense to deal with head movements in the MEG version of this function. E.g. what is now done by ft_headmovement."

I am asking this because I recently committed changes on ft_electroderealign (e.g: alignment of electrodes to FEM headmodels, and output/input have to contain also elecpos) which are not incorporated into ft_sensrealign. Although the reference documentation of ft_sensrealign says now that it aligns also EEG electrodes. \n\nOther option could be that ft_sensrealign should be merged with ft_electroderealign and then it does EEG and also MEG alignment.\n\nLilla\n\n(I assigned this bug for myself.)"

          Since the two are conceptually different, I think that we should call them ft_electroderealign and ft_gradiometerreallign. Having sens in the name suggests that it is a function that will work for either.

          There will be some shared code of course.

          this one was flagged as fixed, but the functions still exist. Also adding electrodes is still supported (which should not, see comment 10).

          Since I again ran into this issue related to bug 2837 (about ECoG electrodes), I now really want to get this out of the way!

          Committed revision 10872.

          I merged the two functions, trying to pick the best functionality from either one throughout.

          I realised from the code that all code assumed electrodes and no code was specifically in place for gradiometers. Hence I removed the mentioning of gradiometers from the documentation. There might be a few methods that will work for gradiometers.

          I removed the manual electrode placement by poking on the surface.

          I added a deprecation warning to ft_sensorrealign. We should not further support or improve that function any more, all effort should be aimed at ft_electroderealign.

          I cleaned up ft_interactiverealign:

          [bug1830-realign 8ca95dd] cleaned up the impplementation of ft_interactiverealign, made it more consistent for the different individual and template objects, made the plotting styles more flexible (defaults stay the same), ensure that the top/bottom/left/right viewpoints are consistent with the template coordsys, removed possibility of plotting MRI as montage (since that does not make sense)

          discussing with JM, we identified three additional items

          1) ft_convert_units is used in scripts and should remain backward compatible
          2) the fiducial clicking is similar to electrode clicking and should become shared code
          3) the cfg.method between the different ft_xxxrealign should become consistent for 'interactive' and 'fiducial'

          Only item 1 will still be done in this issue and will be merged together with https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/504

          I will make separate issues for item 2 and 3.
