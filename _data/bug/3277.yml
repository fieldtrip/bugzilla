I realized that by changing only one line (Line #116) of code in subfunction “ft_statfun_actvsblT.m”, the execution time reduced drastically to be less than an hour.

          The old code is very memory inefficient, which (for large data) makes it slow as well.

          Thanks for the suggestion, I have incorporated it.

          [master 6de5a6d] ENH - speed up ft_statfun_actvsblT, see http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3277 (thanks to Abbas)
