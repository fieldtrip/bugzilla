          *A user had a problem when trying to generate a dipole BEM EEG headmodel. She could run the tutorial up until:

          cfg        = [];
          cfg.method ='dipoli'; % You can also specify 'openmeeg', 'bemcp', or another method.
          vol        = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, bnd);
          Then she got an error related to the failure to read ama files from disk (effectively no ama file was ever written on disk):

          oh, this goes with it:

          Error message:

          an error ocurred while running the dipoli executable - please look at the screen output

          Error in ft_headmodel_dipoli(line 211)



          The problem comes from:

          ama = loadama(amafile); line 31



          fid = fopen(filename, 'rb', 'ieee-le');

          fid=-1 !



          I could replicate the error but I found no solution, so I told the user how to file bugs on the wiki.

        thetext: the error is in dipoli.exe outside fieldtrip. The error message is appropriate ("an error ocurred while running the dipoli executable - please look at the screen output"). I cannot fix this, since I cannot change dipoli.exe
