        thetext: see http://code.google.com/p/xdf and go to the download section. There is an EEGLAB plugin and a simple MATLAB zip file (with mex files). The content of the zip file could go into fieldtrip/external/xdf and actual EEG data import support would be added to ft_filetype and ft_read_header/data/event.

There's an actual user currently trying a workaround, see below.\n \n\nZita Eva Patai eva.patai@psych.ox.ac.uk via donders.ru.nl \nBijlagen09:05 (20 minuten geleden)\n\naan FieldTrip \nEngels\nNederlands   Bericht vertalen\nUitschakelen voor: Engels\nDear FT-ers\n\nI would like to epoch my data, but as it is in a format not supported by Fieldtrip (.xdf), I used Eeglab to convert it, and then converted between Eeglab and FT with the eeg2fieldtrip function. Now i have a FT data structure. \n\nThe data structure looks fine, but it seems that to use ft_definetrial, i need to specify a path to a file to be processed. Is there any way to change this so i can use something in the workspace?\n\nMany thanks"

        thetext: changed to wontfix for now, in order to get a better view on 'high priority' bugs I decide to remove this one from the 'new' list for now. feel free to reopen if needed, in which case some starting attempts for resolution would be highly appreciated.
