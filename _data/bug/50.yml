          Note to self:
          Internally it most likely fully supports overlapping trials
          A check needs to be implemented to:
          - don't output double artifact definitions if the same sample-segment is selected twice, but in different trials
          - when samples overlap between trials, and are selected as artifacts, they should be visualized in all occurrences of those samples, irrespective of in how many trials they are present.

          Hmmm... somebody accidentally fixed this in the meantime it seems.

          Databrowser correctly:
          - marks/visualizes artifacts at each re-occurring sample
          - deletes artifacts at each re-occurring sample, also partially
          - puts artifacts in output only once

          Databrowser incorrectly zooms with overlapping trials when cfg.continuous = 'yes'.
