        thetext: "Hey all,\n\nI made this bug report to inform you about an experimental option in ft_plot_topo.m, that will plot a topo using imagesc and saturation masking. For saving pretty figures in vector format :). Defaults are unchanged. Let's discuss it over here (I might not join to many future meetings due to thesis-binging ;)). I added some random folks who might find this interesting.\n\nThe option is accessible in ft_topoplotER/TFR via:\ncfg.style = 'straight_imsat' and 'both_imsat'. \nI made the names explicitly ugly cause I couldn't decide on a proper name and to make it sound experimental/temporary. \n\nSo, two questions:\n1) Neat?\n2) If answer to 1) is yes, how shall we name the styles? cfg.maskstyle comes to mind, but it's a bit of a misnomer here. In ft_plot_topo NaNs are 'masked' by simply not being plotted as surface/contour-patch elements. (additionally, 'actual' masking using opacity is no longer possible, this has been disabled for some time apparently).\n\n\nIt is implemented in ft_plot_topo.m as two additional styles: 'imsat' and 'imsatiso' (add contour lines), in the same naming scheme as the other styles.\nApart from the above, it was necessary to add 'clim' as an additional input option to use saturation masking (as after the image is plotted using manipulated HSV values, the color axis is fixed)."

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #6)
          Actually, it's mostly identical (ctrl+c/v). To be honest, I cannot see right now why we ever went the route to plot topo's as surfaces, instead of just images (like ft_plot_matrix). Although perhaps the option to set the shading to interp is perhaps why (only possible with patch objects). But for some reason it 'shrinks' the topo towards the lower right corner of the outline, and doesn't really work currently. And the same effect, of smooth color transitions, can be achieved by increasing cfg.gridscale...

          In principle, the two functions (ft_plot_matrix and ft_plot_topo) could share most (as far as I can see) plotting code, and differ mostly in data handling plus some extra's (contour lines, outline of the head, etc)

          I could totally be missing something of course.

          I think the code/documentation is unclear with respect to "masking" (which I consider a binary/boolean operation) and "highlighting" (which can be implemented by emphasising some parts, or partially hiding other parts, e.g. using opacity/saturation).
