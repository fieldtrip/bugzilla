          preproc_window1

          When supplying a vector in ft_databrowser's preproc window, the layout/format of the vector is changed after saving and closing so that the square brackets end up in separate lines from the numbers.

          For example, see attached figure 'preproc_window1' for the preproc window before saving and closing and see figure 'preproc_window2' for the preproc window after reopening the preproc window again. Clicking on 'save and close' then results in a crash.

          Assigned to a named person, to keep this on the radar.

          Could you provide a test-script for this? This could get us started debugging.
          Please, also add this one to the dependency of the mother of all databrowser bugs.

          printmat, which is called by printstruct seems to parse the key-value pair 'cfg.preproc' and [3 45] by first printing the 'cfg.preproc' part, followed by adding '=[', forming a new line, then adding '3 45', followed by a new line with ']'. Turning 'cfg.preproc = [3 45]' into:
          'cfg.preproc = [
          3 45
          ]'

          The function is quite small:
          function str = printmat(name, val)
          siz = size(val);
          if prod(siz)==0
            str = sprintf('%s = [];\n', name);
          elseif prod(siz)==1
            str = sprintf('%s = %s;\n', name, printval(val));
          elseif numel(siz)==2
            str = sprintf('%s = [\n', name);
            for row=1:siz(1)
              for col=1:siz(2)
                str = sprintf('%s %s', str, printval(val(row,col)));
              end
              str = sprintf('%s\n', str);
            end
            str = sprintf('%s];\n', str);
          else
            str = sprintf('%s = %s;\n', name, printval(val));
          end

        thetext: In principle evaluating the code produced by printmat does work in the command window. However, ft_databrowser checks whether each line contains 'cfg.preproc' and it adds a semicolon to each line which makes it impossible to evaluate any value that is spread over multiple lines (although it seems reasonable to allow this).

          Although the main problem related to this bug seems to be related to ft_databrowser, I wonder whether printmat behaves as desired.

          Printmat prints, for example, [1 2 3] as:
          [
          1 2 3
          ]

          Shouldn't printmat print [1 2 3] as it is?
