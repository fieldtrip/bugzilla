          I marked artifacts in my data set using cfgart = ft_databrowser( ... ). When I subsequently want to fill these artifacts with NaNs using ft_rejectartifact and cfg.artfctdef.reject = 'nan', then trials that are completely marked as artifact are ignored; they are neither removed, nor filled with NaNs.

          I uploaded a small data set and example script to the FTP dropbox:
          - tmp_data_small.mat (1.8 MB)
          - tmp_script_3.m
          The example script illustrates the problem, comments are added for each specific step.

          In fact, the function actually reports that the trial is rejected completely, but this is not actually the case.

          Please let me know if anything is unclear. Thanks.

          the nans were only added when any(rejecttrial), nothing was done if all(rejecttrial), which is the case if all samples are marked as 'bad'.

          Fixed with PR 278
