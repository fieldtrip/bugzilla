        thetext: "Hello,\n\nI'm writing a Brainstorm wrapper for ft_prepare_headmodel. It works well for singlesphere and singleshell, but I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with localspheres.\n\nI'm passing a grad structure with a .tra matrix that includes multiple transformation matrices (the CTF 3rd order gradient compensation + a few SSP projectors). \nBy construction this .tra matrix has almost no zero values. In this configuration, line 138 behaves in really weird way: \nhttps://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/forward/ft_headmodel_localspheres.m#L138\n\nAm I missing something, or is it that this function is incompatible with this type of input?\n\nThanks\nFrancois"

          It looks as if the code for the localspheres has not evolved along with the rest of the code-base.

          Once upon a time, we only used unbalanced gradiometer definitions, and this particular line worked well to identify the coils that contribute to a particular gradiometer.

          I suspect that with the current state of the code, we may need to use chanori and chanpos instead.
