          When appending data1 (trials count 33) and data2 (trial count 46) and get data3 with 79 trials.
          trials 1-33 are data1
          trials 34-66 are data1 (!)
          and the remaining trials are the last 32 trials from data2.

          This is very strange, and I look forward to discovering that it is some utterly silly user error on my behalf.

          the way I assessed this is by going trial by trial in ft_databrowser.

          attached is a mat file that has two data structures - and another - called test that has the appended version.

          in data browser you can go to trial 1 and then trial 34 and see that they are identical.

          you can of course browse the parent structures.

          last - it would be nice if trialinfo were concatinated too when doig ft_appenddata.

          I think I made some progress on this bug diagnosis:
          I am not sure anymore that it is appenddata but rather ft_databrowser.

          to witness it, I propose you run ft_appenddata on the two variables, and then open the data browser.

          go to the trial number that should have the first in the second appended variable and compare it to another data browser where you display the first trial.

          those are displayed as identical. When I plot the data directly from the structure (appended) - it actually does have the new data.

          I really don't know what indices ft_databrowser uses. The reality is that in an appended dataset, it fails to count up to the correct trial to display

          best,
          Ayelet

          screenshot of databrowser that shows the problem

          yup, this indeed reveals a problem. See attached screenshot with part1, part2 and in the figure with the  combined data the 33rd trial, which is expected to be the 1st from part2 but seems to be the 1st of the part1.

          I guess it is a problem with sampleinfo...

          I have added the following to the test script

          try
            ft_fetch_data(combined, 'begsample', 1, 'endsample', 50, 'allowoverlap', false);
            status = false; % an error should be given by ft_fetch_data
          catch
            status = true;
          end
          assert(status, 'ft_fetch_data did not detect the error properly');

          I detected two probems in ft_fetch_data:
          1) allowoverlap did not get a default value, causing it to be empty, which is neither true nor false.
          2) the short-cut in detecting that it falls inside one trial cause the overlap detection to fail

The overlap possibillity was added in order to browse segmented data where the last bit of a trial can correspond the first bit of the next trial, i.e. overlapping trials. The only ambiguity here would have been due to data at the edges being different because of filtering artifacts, or other trial specific preprocessing (e.g. demeaning). I added the key-value as exception management. \n\nIt never occurred to me that there would be a situation where the same number in sampleinfo refers to data of different origin. Now that I think of it, is this intended behaviour? Doesn't it make sense to create a 'non-decreasing' sampleinfo when appending? The true meaning of sampleinfo is lost anways. Let's discuss."
