        thetext: Add comments in ft_dipolefitting (or ft_datatype_sens?) to indicate how to pass the information about the 3rd order gradient compensation information to the leadfield computation (needs to be applied to the leadfield), when estimating dipoles.

        thetext: "In general, balancing is applied upon computation of the leadfield. This takes place in ft_compute_leadfield.\nThe sensor-array structure contains a 'tra' field that contains balancing information. \nThe balancing can pertain to higher order gradients, but also creates first-order gradiometers from the single coils (as in e.g. the ctf sensor array), or can do other fancy stuff, such as taking linear combinations of the magnetometer coils if spatial components have been removed from the data.\n\nRe. the 3d order gradients, the coefficients are represented in grad.balance, and are added to this structure upon reading the header information of the data. The function ctf2grad (or bti2grad) adds the system specific info to the gradiometer array.\n\nft_denoise_synthetic allows for toggling the ctf-data to higher order gradiometer representation. Both the time series data, and the 'tra'-matrix in the gradiometer array are updated, to ensure consistent forward models, given the channel data."
