          "Padding can only be done on data that is stored in continuous format, therefore it is not used here. "
          This is outdated and should be changed, but how to? Refer to the documentation of the padding function?

        thetext: data padding is only possible if there is data around the defined trials. The Subject01 dataset was recorded in epoched mode, i.e. it consists of 900 sample segments with gaps in between. The trial function defines these 900 sample segments, reading more data around it would result in discontinuous jumps at sample -300 and +600.

        thetext: "ah right, I see. Then I misunderstood the quote. I was thinking along the lines that we now have mirror padding, edge padding, etc, which could be used (in theory). \n\nAlso, maybe information about the epoched mode should be added, because it is not explained in the tutorial nor in the dataset description"

        thetext: "I have added \n\nThe MEG data are stored as epochs or trials of fixed length around each stimulus trigger, i.e. the file does not represent a continuous record of the data and the data in the inter-trial-interval is not stored. The consequence is that the data cannot be represented as a continuous record, as at the epoch boundaries there is a discontinuity. See also the background on the CTF system.\n\nto the shared documentation, and also some text to the getting_started/ctf section."
