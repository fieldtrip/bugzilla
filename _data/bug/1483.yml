        thetext: I know there are still many 'FIXME's in ft_selectdata_new, but I often have 'rpt' as dimension in my data, and as of now this is not allowed in ft_selectdata_new, even if not selecting over that dimension (i.e. if instead selecting over time or freq).  I know there are many other open bugs on ft_selectdata* (e.g. bug 1021) but just thought I'd make this detail explicit.

        thetext: "I add this here rather than a new bug, as it's related.   ft_selectdata_new does not work with 'avgoverrpt' (tested on 'freq' data, with dimord 'rpt_chan_freq_time').\n\nIf cfg.trials is not specified, then 'selrpt' is NaN on line 251.  This means line 263 is never executed and neither selection nor averaging over rpt occurs.\n\nIf cfg.trials is specified, then the selection and averaging over trials does occur, and the .dimord is appropriately updated to 'chan_freq_time' but the size of the .powspctrm is still 1xCxFxT. \n\nIt seems this needs fixing also for timelock and source data."

          tested, fixed, and tested for frequency domain data.

          -avgoverrpt should now work
          -selection of trials should now work (including tapers in the case of fourierspctrm)

          TO DO: check the other data types

          implemented it for timelock data in ft_selectdata_new.
          implemented it for raw data a while ago.

          closing for now.
