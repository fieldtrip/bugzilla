          Actually, this issue is not a bug, but an archive for the reasons we identified for postponing fixing certain bugs. It is posed here for reference during the bug-binge.

          Can I ask you to pick a few of your own bugs, to state the reason for picking them, and send me an email? Then I'll try to find potential matches between bugs and developers.

          Best,

          Boris
