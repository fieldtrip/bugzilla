          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #2)

          sorry, that was an incomplete comment.

          @Robert S and Benjamin, please have a look at the tutorial. I think we could add as a note that it is possible to read BESA FEM models. However, when finishing bug #2336 we have actually implemented the link of the "interpolated leadfield" from BESA to FieldTrip, which is not FEM specific (although highly relevant for FEM).

          Perhaps we should instead add a section to this tutorial (at the end) explaining how to make an "interpolated leadfield model" out of this, i.e. call ft_prepare_leadfield and call ft_prepare_headmodel once more with the LFs. The  interpolation section would be the appropriate place to mention that one can also read an interpolated leadfield FEM model from BESA.

          There is already a section at the end titled "Headmodel interpolation". Right now it contains two (unrelated) questions/assignments.

          It seems to me that the tutorial up to the "headmodel interpolation" section is precisely describing what BESA MRI does. That again motivates me in suggesting (as in the meeting yesterday) that it makes sense to have the electrode handling in BESA MRI and not require the BESA Research excursion.
