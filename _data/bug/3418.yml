        thetext: "I am a new FieldTrip user. I am trying to run a script that a colleague has sent me, which is basically a wrapper script to call the ft_freqstatistics calculations. They work fine on his computer, which has a 2012 version of FieldTrip and Matlab 2013a. \n\nBut when we try to run either a later version of Fieldtrip (e.g. 2015) or a later version of Matlab (e.g. 2017b), we get the following bug:\n\nError using findcluster (line 50)\ninvalid dimension of spatdimneighbstructmat\n\nError in clusterstat (line 201)\n      posclusobs = findcluster(reshape(postailobs, [cfg.dim,1]),channeighbstructmat,cfg.minnbchan);\n\nError in ft_statistics_montecarlo (line 348)\n  [stat, cfg] = clusterstat(cfg, statrand, statobs);\n\nError in ft_freqstatistics (line 193)\n    [stat, cfg] = statmethod(cfg, dat, design);\n\nThe bug seems to occur irrespective of whether we are running the analyses on PC or Mac. \n\nI have just recreated the bug with a clean install on a Mac, with the latest version of Fieldtrip and Matlab 2016a. \n\nI attach the wrapper script and a sample dataset that causes the crash on our systems.\n\nMany thanks, \n\nSam"
