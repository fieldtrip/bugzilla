        thetext: "added cfg.viewmode=ortho|surface to allow fiducials to be clicked on head surface (see http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=2707). Also overhauled the general documentation, removing the already obsolete landmark method (which is now a special case of fiducial).\n\nmac011> svn commit \nSending        ft_electroderealign.m\nSending        ft_volumerealign.m\nTransmitting file data ..\nCommitted revision 9928.\n\n@Tzvetan: you might or might not see the vitamin E markers, as they will not be reliably segmented and converted to the surface mesh. The surface method is especially useful if there are no markers, and you have to click on specific points of the ears."
