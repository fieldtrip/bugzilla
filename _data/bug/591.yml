        thetext: "Right now ft_neighbourplot allows (1) cfg.neighbours, or (2) neighbours to be a third input, or (3) call ft_neighbourselection if not either (1) or (2).  Fixing this bug will remove option (3), but I'm wondering whether option (2) makes sense?  It seems unconventional for FT code/structure. I would rather require users to put it in cfg.\n\nFor ft_scalpcurrentdensity.m, cfg.neighbours should now be made a required input if cfg.method ='hjorth'.  This is straightforward.  \nHowever, why does ft_neighbourselection get called if isfield(cfg,'layout') when computing the 'elec' structure in line 122?  It seems unnecessary/unused."

          For sclapcurrentdensity, I just removed neighbourselection if cfg.layout (it looks like a copy/paste error), and added if strcmp(cfg.method, 'hjorth'),   cfg = ft_checkconfig(cfg, 'required', {'neighbours'}); end

          Now, I will start look into these cases, where ft_neighbourselection is not called explicitly, but a neighbourstructure is constructed anyway (paknar gradient, repairchannel, and what else might be there)
