          ... since it is basically the same as virtual electrodes, but then with real electrodes ;-)


          I discussed this with Arjen, Sandon and Jan-Mathijs. If the data contains sens.chanpos, then ft_checkdata should allow on-the-fly conversion of timelock/freq data to source data.

        thetext: "In the ft_sourceplot implementation I noticed that it would do \n\nfun = fun(inside)\n\nwhere inside is a boolean vector. This caused the time and/or frequency dimension to be  discarded. I changed it into \n\nfun = fun(inside,:,:)\n\nso that it does not take the first (time/frequency) slice, but that it selects all time/frequency.\n\nThis reveals that the cloud plotting does not yet allow for either selecting the latency/frequency, nor for browsing through it. I think that the browsing through time/frequency is only implemented for method=ortho. For all others (including method=cloud) it would be good at least to implement latency/frequency selection."

          I improved ft_sourceplot a bit and added a test case to the script.

          [bug3275-sourceplot 3b6472f] ENH _ improve detection of 4d or 5d source structures, enhanced test script in line with http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c2

          I will discuss with Jan-Mathijs how to proceed in general with the implementation of ft_sourceplot w.r.t. time and/or frequency.

          The only cfg.method in ft_sourceplot that presently supports time and/or frequency is method=ortho. For the others I am now giving an explicit error. I also added cfg.latency/cfg.frequency and cfg.avgovertime/avgoverfreq options. That allows for all methods to select a single time and frequency.

          The issue is resolved with https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/386

          Of course there are still improvements to make, but I think it is already in a usable state.

          Not sure where you mentioned it earlier, but I tried running test_bu3275 which gave me the following issue

          Undefined function 'fieldnames' for input arguments of type 'double'.

          Error in ft_selectdata (line 140)
              restoreavg = fieldnames(varargin{1}.avg);

          Error in ft_sourceplot (line 295)
            functional = ft_selectdata(tmpcfg, functional);

          Tried debugging it by removing the avg field from the statement at line 140, but ran into issues further downstream suggesting me that I was overlooking something here.

          (In reply to Arjen Stolk from comment #5)

          I also noticed the bug. It was due to the field timelock.avg. Shen converted to source.avg, some code assumes that it is a structure (e.g. containing source.avg.pow).

          I made some other small cleanups as well. They are merged in the master branch.

          [master 27a0421] FIX - small fix related to conversion of timelock to source data for iEEEG plotting, see http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c5
