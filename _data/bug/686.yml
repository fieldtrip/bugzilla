          Onderwerp: Re: electrodes referencing in the lead fields

          Hi Christiano,

          Thanks for the info. We'll probably only start using that for SPM12,
          and then I'll let you and Robert know how it works.

          There was a question on the SPM list about units of dipole waveforms.
          See

          http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=SPM;d3858c53.1105

          The function in question just multiplies the data by pseudo-inverse
          of
          the lead field. So if MEG data is in T and EEG data in uV and SPM
          head
          model in mm, what would be the resulting units, and are the units
          actually correct for BEMCP and for MEG models?

          Thanks,

          Vladimir

          regarding 1) ft_read_header and ft_chantype should share code for hdr.orig.

          hdr.orig is always available in ft_read_header, but might not always be available in ft_chantype. Hence ft_chantype needs other heuristics as well (e.g. based on channel name).

          regarding 5) the ft_headmodel_xxx functions should get consistent geometrical inputs. These functions form the layer that know about the low-level code requirements. Suggested is that the functions require SI units for the anatomical mesh (or convert the mesh units to m if needed).

          regarding 6) this function gets the head model and the sensors and consequently should ensure that the sensor description is expressed in SI units.

          I checked the code, I think there is not much that can be shared which is not shared now. The interesting stuff should be further down in the code (e.g. in xxx2grad) and not in ft_chantype and ft_chanunit.

          It is indeed good to try and finish this. I still have some emails to dig through, but given the quiet donders atmosphere at the moment (most people are still on holiday), expect that I can work on it. How about your availability?
