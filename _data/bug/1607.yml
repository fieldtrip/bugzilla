          During preprocessing I lost some channels which I got back through ft_channelrepair after which the channel order changed per subject.
          I realigned the channel order and the associated data structure of each subject to one reference order after which the topoplots look completely different. They look even worse than before realignment. Anybody got a clue where the confusion arises?
          Attached a script and two data files, one with reference data and one with the to be aligned data.

          try doing:
              nERPdata_nD_left{isubject}.avg(loc,:) = ERPdata_nD_left{isubject}.avg(:,:);     % realign data to ref channel order
           instead then it works fine

        thetext: On second thought, the initial 'bug' was no bug and Stephen's second thoughts might have been related to bug1986. Therefore I've changed the status to invalid.
