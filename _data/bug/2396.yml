          ft_iso2surf deals with the following formats
                  case {'.dfs';'.DFS'}
                  case {'.mesh';'.MESH'}
                  case {'.surf','.SURF'}

          In contrast to ft_read_headshape, which reads one mesh at a time, it reads multiple in one go and also does some additional processing on the meshes. The additional processing (validation and fixing) is BEM specific and needs to go to fieldtrip/ft_prepare_headmodel.

          However, the required coordinate transformation was not clear to me. I implemented something, but suspect it to be incorrect.

          @Daniel, could you please have a look at ft_read_headshape around line 815?

          freesurfer surf files are already supported in ft_read_headshape. Also reading multiple surfaces is supported, but that was only implemented and tested for 2 freesurfer hemispheres, never for multiple BEM boundaries.

          It would help if I would get some example data in brainvisa or brainsuite format thaht describes the complete BEM model. Right now I have been testing with example data zip files from the respective websites, which does not include much of relevance of forward modeling.

          can you use one of these?

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_should_i_send_example_data_to_the_developers

          ---

          Btw, I just tried

          >> mesh = ft_read_headshape({'2467264.left.mid.cortex.dfs', '2467264.right.mid.cortex.dfs'})
          >> ft_plot_headshape(shape); camlight; lighting gouraud

          and it is clear that in this case the coordinate transformation from the MRI does not make sense. However, If I only use the translation like this

                  transform = eye(4);
                  transform(1:3,4) = mri.transform(1:3,4);

          it does make more sense.

          Any ideas?

          The MRI I was using for development had no scaling or rotational transform - only translational.  So, probably that's why it worked for me.  So, it looks like BrainSuite DFS actually only reports the MRI coordinates, without the transformation (assuming your test MR has both scaling and rotations).

          I've uploaded the sample MRI and segmentation files I used to:
          https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kvjjxzp5sak4q01/j2qwo4aFln

          We should definitely test for various MRI transformations including negative scaling (which has broken things for me in the past).

          @Robert: It looks good. The dfs section requires the MRI file to be in the same directory as the dfs (should we add support for older .hdr/.img formats as well?), with the same filename.  Should we make mention of this file organization requirement in the help section?

          Also, the warning "returning vertices in voxel coordinates" is not quite accurate since as we found out, the BrainSuite seems apply the rotations, but not the translations - so without the MR, we end up with somewhat useless coordinates.

          And finally, I guess the tissue sorting section (allows for N-numbers of tissues) can go into another appropriate function.

          I think that documenting it in ft_read_headshape is not the best place. How about combing your two points and change it into

          warning('could not find accompanying MRI file, not applying any translation to vertices, see URL')

          where URL is a pointer to a faq that can explain the expected organization?

          That is a bit similar to these two cases

          mac001> grep warning.*faq *.m
          ft_defaults.m:  warning_once('You probably used addpath(genpath(''path_to_fieldtrip'')), this can lead to unexpected behaviour. See http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/should_i_add_fieldtrip_with_all_subdirectories_to_my_matlab_path');
          ft_prepare_neighbours.m:      warning('Neuromagr06 system detected - be aware of different sensor types, see http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/why_are_there_multiple_neighbour_templates_for_the_neuromag306_system');

          In a recent discussion with the FT team we also discussed warnings and more obscure documentation sections, see http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/meeting/20131030

          Hi Robert,

          I just looked over the comments in your test code (test_bug2396). I noticed the comment on line 56 says 'it seems to be in CTF coordinates, i.e. positive y axis through nasion', with regards to the tissue-labeled MRI generated by BrainSuite.  I'm actually not sure what coordinate system was applied to the tissue-labeled MR since BrainSuite does not ask the user to specify fiducials.  In practice, I've been setting seg.transform = mri.transform since the voxels themselves are not resliced.  I'm guessing this is something you would rather leave for documentation rather than in-FieldTrip coding.

          Dan
