        thetext: "Get a better understanding about the zigzags that sometimes show up when doing spectral factorization. \n\nSome insights:\n-In the past there was an issue with the DC-bin, causing a lot of trouble: this has been addressed in current versions of the code (i.e. explicit demeaning prior to spectral estimation, and applying an appropriate weight when creating the two-sided spectra)\n-Craig and JM at some point found out that the initialization of the algorithm sometimes caused the zigzags (i.e. sometimes with a cholesky decomposition of a random matrix there was a zigzag, while taking a 'data driven' initialization got rid of it, or the other way around).\n\nGeorgios and JM discussed:\n-It could well be a numerical issue, that is amplified by the sequential fft's and ifft's (wit intermediate zeroing out of part of the spectrum, potentially causing discontinuities).\n-It could be caused by a suboptimal implementation of the fft algorithm used -> action point for Georgios\n-It could be caused by the signals being too collinear (i.e. possibly almost identical at high frequencies). Adding a tiny bit of uncorrelated noise would address this. -> action point for JM\n\n-To keep in mind (if the discontinuity in the spectrum is the cause of all this: investigate of post-hoc tapering of the zero'd spectrum (i.e. convolving with the fft of a taper) smoothes out the discontinuity.\n\nAt some point Martin and JM discussed:\n-In the algorithm, at some point the spectral matrix is sandwiched between the inverse of the transfer matrix. If this inverse is not well behaved it could lead to numerical problems as well"

        thetext: We can also bring Dhamala, Ding and Rangarajan into the discussion at any point.  I think they would be interested in helping and were before.  So once we develop a test set which reproduces the zigzags, it might be a good idea to send it to them and see if they can see where things get pathological.

          I created a test function on fieldtrip/test/test_bug2342.m

          Initial conclusion: padding on synthetic data makes a bit of a difference, but does not help in the extreme case, when the time series are collinear (leading to huge zigzags, probably because the inverse of the 'psi' matrix blows up).

          getting back to my initial conclusion: there's a typo in the function cfg.padding should read cfg.pad.

          effect of padding still to be investigated...

        thetext: "With one of the kids keeping me awake last night, I realized that there may be an issue regarding how the sfactorization_wilson code creates the two-sided spectral density matrix from the one-sided input. The code assumes all frequency bins to be weighted with 1, whereas ft_freqanalysis explicitly weights the non-DC and non-Nyquist frequency bins by a factor of 2, to account for the 'negative frequencies'.\nI therefore weighted the DC-bin twice as heavy when creating the two-sided spectral density, and computed Granger causality for a pair of channels (based on real data) with massive zigzags (i.e. Granger with zigzag figure). The result is shown in the attachment \"Granger with proper weighting of DC bin prior to NPSF\". \nI will incoporate this change in the code.\nFortunately, the results don't look altogether too different (for this channel pair) when comparing it with the smoothed zigzags (figure attached: Granger with zigzag smoothed)."

          Hi Martin,

          Could you quickly see how it now behaves (without the tapering) after my change to the DC-bin weighting?

Is the zig zag reduced dramatically just by the DC-bin correction?\nI am mostly asking to get an idea about the validity of existing results , computed prior to the DC-bin correction. \n\n\nA second question regarding the larger number of frequency bins is the following:\n\nAre the zigzags reduced if you just keep the frequency range(meaningfully wide) fixed and just increase the resolution? i.e. freqRange1= 1:1:100  as compared to freqRange2=1:0.1:100. \n\nOr is it that you need a larger frequency range? i.e freqRange1=1:1:100 as compared to freqRange2=1:1:500 ?\n\nI ll give it also a try this weekend.\n\nGiorgos"

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #15)\n\nhi JM\n\nIt seems you corrected a bug indeed. This helps a bit as the DC would cause additional ringing.\n\nHowever, the zig-zagging issue is not fully solved. In the test script I sent you by mail you'll see that the zig-zagging is still there. It's not just the zig-zagging but in some cases of zig-zagging the algorithm completely goes astray.\n\nAs you can see the 'solution' I proposed strongly reduces the problem (if my test script is correct, at least) although as you'll see there are cases where it fails. \n\nBest\n\nMartin."

          for best performance the freq bins must be taken from 0 to the nyquist.
