          hi Jakub and Johannes,


          I am trying to use the prepare_volume_mesh_segmentation function that Johannes sent me a few days ago, but I couldn't run it.

          I did the following: I copied this function and also vgrid.m to fieldtrip/external/simbio, I created an example segmentation structure (fieldtrip style):


          disp(singlesphere)

          dim:       [91 104 111]
          transform: [4x4 double]
          coordsys:  'ctf'
          unit:      'mm'
          seg:       [91 104 111]     % this is binary mask of a sphere

          and I called:
          cfg=[];
          cfg.tissue = 'seg';
          mesh = prepare_volume_mesh_segmentation(cfg,singlesphere)

          but I get an error:

          vgrid is writing the wireframe mesh file, this may take some time ...
          ./tp26314fb9_afbb_43e8_9e1e_19dbd6020202.sh: line 2: /home/mrphys/lilmag/matlab/fieldtrip/external/simbio/vgrid: No such file or directory

          Could you help me why it does not work out for me? What did you use an input for the function? Or is this a problem with the path?

          Hi Lilla,

          you have to put the vgrid.m exactly into the folder where the vgrid binary is located, since it is just a dummy-file so that matlab can locate the binary. Usually this would be /external/simbio/vgrid1.3.1/program/.

          You have to obey that the binary is compiled under linux at the moment, I might have a try to compile it on a mac the next days.

          Best, Johannes

          Resolution in this case means how vgrid proceeds with the given vista-image, resolution 1 means a direct transformation, where each voxel is transformed to a hexaeder. Resolution 2 will then mean 8 voxels to a hexaeder, non-integer steps would force a resampling.

          But, since I am not totally sure, how this resampling is executed, I think we should mainly not use it and better do a resampling inside matlab with fieldtrip-functions and then create a mesh with vgrid afterwards, which would probably then need to be transformed in matlab.

          Forcing vgrid to always create cubic elements should already be done by the switch "-elem cube" (line 118), did you experience cases, where this did not happen? I never experienced that before, I would have to have a look at that.

          Regarding splitting creation of tetrahedral and hexahdreal meshes:
          This function is meant for creating hexahedral meshes only. vgrid is not a program one should use to create tetrahedral meshes, since it simply splits up hexahedras into tetrahedras to achieve this, which mainly means a much higher computational effort, without having the advantages of tetrahedral meshes (better shape of compartment boundaries etc.).

          For tetrahedral meshes indeed a second function needs to be written, which should then implement a tetgen call.

          Ok, I found the error, will fix it soon.

          For the second part:
          The tissuelabels do not directly fix which values in the tissues vector correspond to which compartment, it is more important to identify the different compartments clearly so that we are able to assign the correct conductivities later on.

          hi Johannes,

          I attached the screenshots of two hexahedral meshes (sorry for the file descriptions, I always mix up hexagons with hexahedrals). I created an example segmentation (script for it in test/test_prepare_mesh_hexahedral) with really small radius (1 and 2 mms) and so I got meshes which contained only a few elements. Then I wrote them with ft_write_headshape into ply format and I opened them in paraview.

          I am wondering if the hexahedrons should look like this... Could you take a look on the images, please? thanks.

          hi all,

          I plotted the meshes also with ft_plot_mesh, and they looked fine. So, it seems that problem arises when ft_write_headshape writes the mesh into 'ply' format. I will make an other bug for this, and I think we can conclude now that the hexahedral meshes are fine.

          Therefore, I will close this bug.

          P.s. I also inserted a ft_hastoolbox('simbio',1) in prepare_mesh_hexahedral, otherwise it doesn't run.

          Best,
          Lilla
