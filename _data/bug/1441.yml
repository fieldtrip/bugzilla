          So far only scripts in $FIELDTRIP-ROOT/test were run. Additional dirs that seem to contain tests are:

          $ for d in `find -type d -name "*test*"`; do echo $d: `ls $d | wc -l` ; done
          ./preproc/test: 0
          ./external/mne/test: 5
          ./external/simbio/test: 4
          ./external/simbio/vgrid1.3.1/program/test: 17
          ./inverse/test: 0
          ./plotting/test: 15
          ./connectivity/test: 0
          ./specest/test: 0
          ./fileio/test: 4
          ./contrib/spike/test: 13
          ./realtime/buffer/test: 55
          ./realtime/buffer/cpp/tests: 1
          ./test: 163
          ./forward/test: 25

          I can enable all test*.m files in all subdirs for automated testing. But should we run test scripts in external packages by default?

          Exceptional dirs (that is, no subdir names 'test') that contain test*.m files are:
          $ find . -name "test*.m" | xargs -n1 dirname | sort | uniq | grep -v test
          ./external/openmeeg
          ./fileio/@uint64

          boris,

          I think you should run tests of external packages otherwise you will keep breaking
          other people's code. I can do whatever I can to make sure MNE tests and OpenMEEG
          tests pass on your buildbot.

          Feel free to rename my OpenMEEG functions to match the Fieldtrip test triggers.

          Ok, good point. I am not completely familiar how Fieldtip's OpenMEEG is updated with an upstream version; if I rename the test scripts, would that complicate keeping FT's OpenMEEG up to date?

          most OpenMEEG users use the last released version. So no need to update OpenMEEG
          on a nightly basis.

          can you run the tests yourself?

          > if I rename the test scripts, would that complicate

          no go ahead. Let me know when you do so I can try.

          can you run the tests yourself?

          I just tried running testOpenMEEGeeg in the external/openmeeg dir, and
          it complains that it cannot find OpenMEEG. I'll ask Cristiano if he
          knows more.

          do you have openmeeg installed?

          can you do:

          system('om_assemble')

          ?

          if it complains about not finding some libraries make sure the
          the lib folder is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH on linux or in DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on mac.

          assertElementsAlmostEqual comes from the mtest package :

          http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22846-matlab-xunit-test-framework

          feel free to rewrite this test without this dependency if needed.
          You just need the equivalent of

          from numpy.testing import assert_array_almost_equal # in python

          if you have errors at the 3 decimal feel free to increase the threshold.

          Thanks. The test scripts now run successfully. It is not yet reflected in the test dashboard [1] (the openMEEG installation needs to be completed on the cluster).
