          Hello,

          I wonder why I have to precise the time of interest when I do freqanalysis. I always want to be the more precise possible so I would like to enter something like cfg.toi = 'all';
          Instead I have to do cfg.toi = data.time;

          Also, in the documentation of this function, it is not mentioned that we can set cfg.precision = 'single' to use less memory.

          (In reply to comment #0)
          Typically computation of time-frequency representations will take a very long time (and a lot of memory) if you want to compute an estimate at each time point. Furthermore, and more importantly, this results in a massive oversampling: since each estimate is based on a time window, then estimating at time steps closer to each other than the length of (half) the time window will not actually give you more data.

          If you do want to estimate at each time point, then feel free to use cfg.toi = data.time{1}. This hardly seems like more work than typing cfg.toi = 'all', or am I missing something?

          Finally, perhaps things like these are better posted on our e-mail list than on bugzilla: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/discussion_list . Thanks!
