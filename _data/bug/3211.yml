          report from Marseille workshop:

          in a standard approach, one of the participants ran into the thing that has been mentioned in the title. At first sight, all seems to have been executed OK, so it's not clear to me what is happening.

          - try and quickly replicate this
          - if the problem is indeed persistent: fix it

          we are using fieldtrip20161014

          my first attempt at reproduction of this bug failed surprisingly.

          I did it on my Mac (OS el capitan), matlab 2015b + latest version of fieldtrip,

          interpolating a randn(npos,1) 'avg.pow' field of the standard sourcemodel 10 mm onto the single_subj_T1.nii

          No reshaping problems etc.

          (In reply to Hesham from comment #3)

          Ah, I see.

          Then it probably translates to the fact that if the pos-list is not reshapable into a 3D, this strange behavior happens.

          Can you upload the original (full) pos-list, and the dim-vector (i.e. number of x/y/z voxels)?
