        thetext: If components are rejected from the data by using ft_rejectcomponent(cfg, comp) and subsequently the resulting data are used for source analysis, the gradiometer description (which is not present in comp anyway), which may be obtained from an earlier processing step, does not correctly represent the balancing in the tra-matrix. Thus leadfields computed from the grad are not correct for the data at hand. The consequence for the results is hard to predict, but at least it is not correct. Investigate whether a warning is sufficient or come up with a solution

        thetext: I now added the application of the mixing matrix to the sensor description in ft_componentanalysis. As a consequence. ft_rejectcomponent now reconstructs the sensor-array with the appropriate balancing, also if only 2 input arguments are provided.
