          The black patch has been created to allow a sort of gray-scale I think, although it is not entirely clear to me why it would be done like this. A semi-transparent TFR over a black patch wouldn't really be gray...?
          Defaulting the masking of NaNs to 'no' also surprises me, and is not consistent with other plotting functions.

          This bugs is not caused by ft_multiplotTFR, but by the automatic creating of the layout from data.grad (stuff was actually plotted, but so tiny it was unobservable).

        thetext: "(commented on wrong bug)\nBug fixed. Reverted to the old situation during a fixing spree in ft_multiplotTFR. The code for creating black patches has been removed (masking should be done inside ft_plot_matrix, and I doubt whether it ever worked), nan-masking is set to default again. Also, plotting the layout is now by default set to no again, just as in the tutorials. \n(commit will follow soon)"
