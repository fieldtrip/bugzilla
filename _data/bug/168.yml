        thetext: I added ft_ prefixes to (hopefully) all Fieldtrip function calls in realtime and realtime/datasource. ft_realtime_topography and ft_realtime_downsample contain a call to "preproc" which I don't know anything about.

          Replaced call to preproc in ft_realtime_downsampling with online_filter + online_downsampling helper functions from utility (handling continouos stream), and added cfg options to specify downsampling rate etc.

          Don't know how to deal with ft_realtime_topography's preproc (or even what that does).

          All the others functions should now be properly prefixed.

          Hi Robert,

          I notice that test_bug168 does not finish. The documentation states that ft_realtime_topography has to be ended with Ctrl-C. Is it expected that this test script finishes? If not, I would suggest to exclude this file form automated testing.

          Boris

          (In reply to comment #6)

          It should somehow be excluded from automated testing. I suggest to add a "return" statement and a comment to the beginning of the code. Testing then requires someone to copy and paste the part after the return.

          I fixed it by renaming the file to inspect_bug168; the file name now indicates that human action is required, and it simultaneously exclude the file from being tested automatically (trigger is now a filename matching "*test/test*.m").

          Would you favor your suggestion instead?
