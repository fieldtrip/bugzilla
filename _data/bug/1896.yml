        thetext: Dear all, trying to do a TF-analysis a got an error message from matlab when running ft_freqanalyis. I did not alter the script I was using, and yesterday it worked fine. Below I added the script I am using and the matlab error message I got. Hope you can help, thanks, Niels

          (In reply to comment #1)

          Hi Niels,

          There has been a short period during which there was a buggy FT version on home/common, which probably was the cause for your error. I believe this is resolved now. Can you please confirm that it again works?
