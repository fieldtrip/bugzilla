          I made a branch "bug3207-edf" and started testing with the provided dataset. With test3_2048Hz.EDF I already detected an error, since the annotation channel was not (as expected in the code) the last one in the file. I fixed that.

          commit 378418254396ac0966deadc0b823dd7f6e7b88ad
          FIX - don't assume the annotation channel is always the last, it can be another one as well. See http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3207

          commit fde31b5bd546ff86aade208c8cd0d5e0619959e4
          ENH - use emptymeaningfull=true for detectflank, otherwise EDF annotation cannot be read. See http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3207

          @Mark, can you get the latest version of fieldtrip and have a look at the last section of the test script at https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/test/test_bug3207.m

          it makes use of the following trial function

          ----

          function [trl, event] = trialfun_edf(cfg)

          % read the header
          hdr = ft_read_header(cfg.dataset);

          % read the events, don't detect flanks in a trigger channel but read annotations
          event = ft_read_event(cfg.dataset, 'detectflank', []);

          % make a selection
          sel = ismember({event.value}, {''});

          % determine the sample numbers of events
          smp = [event(sel).sample];

          begsample = smp-round(0.250*hdr.Fs);
          endsample = smp+round(0.750*hdr.Fs);
          offset    = -ones(size(begsample))*round(0.250*hdr.Fs);

          trl = [begsample(:) endsample(:) offset(:)];

          sel = trl(:,1)>1;
          trl = trl(sel,:);

          sel = trl(:,2)<hdr.nSamples;
          trl = trl(sel,:);

          -----

          The option 'detectflank'=[] is important, since otherwise it will try to read a sampled TTL trigger channel and detect up- or downing flanks in that channel. If [] it will read and parse the ascii content of the annotation channel.

          with 64bit matlab version I get events in the larger edf file, with the smaller I get an error from read_16bit.
          In the larger file that does give events I only get 'annotation' for each event not what was written.
          I set detectflank to [] when calling ft_read_event but it gets set to 'up' at around line 145 of ft_read_event. I only get events if I set detectflank to [] in ft_read_event

          Will try again with a different PC

          the edits that I made on 2016-11-16 will not be in version 20161115. You can also get the latest version directly from github as a zip file (or using git).
