          Biosemi offers a driver for 64-bit OSX, see http://www.biosemi.com/download.htm. But this driver does not seem to work with our biosemi2ft. The call that dynamically opens the .dylib returns an error for some reason. See [1].

          All other acquisition systems are compiled for 64-bit, and are stored in 'realtime/bin/maci64'. It would be very convenient if we could make biosemi2ft 64-bit as well.

ActiView for Mac (application, executable) can be downloaded here: ActiViewForMac7.05 (June 14th, 2013, the USB driver is included inside the application). The RunTimeEngine for Mac can be downloaded here: RunTimeEngineMac8.6.1\nActiView sourcecode for Mac (LabVIEW full development required) can be downloaded here: ActiViewSourcecodeMac7.05\n-----\n\nthis has been updated since this bug was posted. So perhaps it is now possible to compile biosemi2ft on 64 bit mac.\n\nBut since nobody is actively working on this, I suggest not to spend further time on this issue at the moment."
