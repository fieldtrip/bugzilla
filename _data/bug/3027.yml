          ----
          There are two other versions of the control and acquisition software installed on the PC. They both have shortcuts on the desktop.

          ‘nts4_v2.0.exe’ is a new version of the UCL code, that writes data to file for all source-detector combinations, regardless of whether they are being used or not. This allows the data file to be used with the HOMER analysis software. A further conversion process is needed first though. This is provided by the ‘nts2nirs.m’ matlab script. This is in the folder ‘Matlab code/code for data conversion to HOMER format’.

          ‘nts_lscp.exe’ is the software that has been written by the Paris group. This has more functionality than the UCL code. Unfortunately though, it does not have an instruction manual yet.

          The Matlab scripts that we currently use for data analysis are contained in the folder ‘Matlab code/NTS data analysis code september 2012’.
          ----

          The "Paris group" was also mentioned by Jan-Mathijs, I suppose they are an important user of the system that have contributed their developments back to the UCL group who has subsequently been sharing it with DCC. Or do we have a direct relation with the "Paris group"? Does anyone have a link to the "Paris group"?

          Hi,

          interfacing with Homer should be really simple, as it relies on a well-defined data format (.nirs). The .nirs file is a .mat file in disguise (i.e. saved .mat with another extension). All details on the .nirs files can be found here:

          http://homer-fnirs.org/faq/#format

          I'm gonna paste it here:

          2. NIRS data format
          The most basic unit of a HOMER2 data set is a matlab file in the NIRS format that is the result of data acquisition. An example of a device that generates files in this format is the continuous wave techen device called cw6.
          The NIRS format has the following fields as a minimum requirement:
          t - This variable is the data time points array. It contains the data acquisition times. The dimensions of this array are <number of time points> by 1.
          d - This variable is the raw intensity time course. It is a 2D array where each element in row i, column j contains the raw intensity at time point i, in channel j. The dimensions of this array are <number of time points> by <number of measurement channels>
          SD - This is a structured variable containing the source/detector geometry. It has the following fields:
          Lambda - Wavelengths used for data acquisition; dimensions <number of wavelengths> by 1
          SrcPos - Array of probe coordinates of the lasers; dimensions <number of lasers> by 3
          DetPos - Array of probe coordinates of the detectors; dimensions <number of detectors> by 3
          nSrcs - Number of lasers; scalar variable
          nDets - Number of detectors; scalar variable
          MeasList - List of source/detector/wavelength measurement channels. It’s an array with
          dimensions, <number of channels> by 4. The meaning of the 4 columns are as follows:
          Column 1 index of the source from the SD.SrcPos list.
          Column 2 index of the detector from the SD.DetPos list.
          Column 3 is unused right now and contains all ones.
          Column 4 index of the wavelength from SD.Lambda.
          4
          s - This variable specifies the time points and condition of stimulus onsets. Conditions are a way to separate stimuli into different groups, where each group is averaged independently of stimuli belonging to other conditions. Initially the values in s are binary; 1 at time point i designating stimulus onset, 0 designating no stimulus at time point i. Note: Values of 1 can be modified during a Homer2_UI session to be -1 or -2 depending on how they are disabled. The dimensions of s are <number of time points> by <number of conditions>.
          ml - List of source-detector channels. This is a duplicate of the SD.MeasList above.
          aux - auxiliary signal of same dimensions as t.
          In addition to the above parameters, additional parameters can appear in the NIRS file as a result of processing the data set in Homer2_UI (see section 6.6).


          I do not think we need any other information. I wrote an export function for our proprietary data format, and that information was sufficient.

          @Robert: that pdf has indeed been written by Sarah Lloyd-Fox, who is a
          leading person in the infant nirs community, working in London. She is
          not involved in our newer nirs projects, but Ricarda Braukmann works with
          her in a collaborative infant-at-risk-for-autism EU consortium. Ricarda has
          spent several months in London to learn how to apply nirs and has been
          familiarized with their analysis pipeline. I have used the pdf as source
          for inspiration (Ricarda brought it to Nijmegen), to see how others perform
          their analyses. However, we decided not to use their (Matlab) scripts for
          our analyses, as they contained a couple of mistakes, and were tailor-made
          for their research design (with an in-built trial length differing from
          ours, a fixed number of conditions and triggers etcetera).

          @Robert: Yes and no. The acquisition machine is the same. Ricarda has used the same headgear as the people at Birkbeck (including Sarah Lloyd-Fox, she works at CBCD at Birkbeck) in studies for the EU consortium on autism (caled EU AIMS). However, together with the "instrumentenmakerij", we have worked on new head gear / caps, as the ones used in London do not allow testing central sites, and we are interested in motor regions. We came up with an EEG cap that Norbert adjusted for us. I can send you pictures if that is useful?

          @Robert: there has been contact in the past with this "Paris group", as Alex Cristia worked for a couple of months at the MPI in Nijmegen, and she is part of the babylab in Paris (http://www.lscp.net/BabyWeb/equipe/chercheurs.php). The nirs system (same type as we now have at the DCCN) was shipped from Paris to the DCCN. Initially, the idea was to collaborate within the Donders during the period the system was here (6 months) on novel projects, also for us to try out the system. Unfortunately, this didn't work out. Alex has provided us with a demo, and as far as we could understand, the special aspect of the acquisition software developed in Paris, is that it synchs all the computers, like tv-crews can do to make sure that if they film a tv-screen, you don't see a flickering screen (at least, that is how I understood it). To our minds, this was far more sophisticated than we would need, an idea that was confirmed by the developer of our nirs acquisition machine when we discussed it with him.

        thetext: "(In reply to Jörn M. Horschig from comment #7)\n\nHi,\n\nShort question about this: we have indeed a script converting the data files from the nts nirs system (which is located at DCCN, the .txt files) into .nirs files (the type used by Homer). For us, it would be okay to first change our files into .nirs files and then convert them into files readable for Fieldtrip. \n\nIf we would proceed like this, should I then still make a documentation sheet about how our raw data files are built up? I started writing an overview, so it is no problem for me to send it to you in a couple of days from now, but I am not sure what the most logical approach is? (nts --> Fieldtrip, or nts --> Homer --> Fieldtrip) \n\nOther users of the NTS nirs system will have to build their own structure for explaining which detectors where placed where and should be connected in the data analyses to which sources (so which source-detector pairs form a channel), regardless of the route we now choose. Homer has a GUI (called SD_GUI) for creating a file specifying these details (called .SD files, another file format which is a Matlab file in disguise). I've tried using the GUI and failed, but it did provide me insight in how to build an SD file in Matlab from scratch. What I could do, if we opt for going for the longer path (with .nirs files as an in-between step), is create some documentation about how to build/adjust an SD file given data from the NTS machine. The longer path is to some extent logical, as there will be many more people knowing how to convert their data into .nirs files, than people using exactly the same type of nirs acquisition machine, the nts, like we do in the Nijmegen babylab.\n\nBest,\nJanny"

          Hi Janny,

          sorry for the slow reply. I was not sure if Robert wanted to comment on this or not. But, given the time passed, I guess not ;)

          I'd be pragmatic if I were you and do whatever seems less work for you. Intuitively, I would say Homer->FT would rather easy to do, but there are some inherent limitation that we also currently face.For example optodes are usually placed in an arbitrary coordinate system relative to each other. This does not allow for a topographic plot on a head. Other than that I am not sure what data fields FT needs that Homer does not have. I would propose to make a comparison of the two data representations side-by-side. Maybe start a page on the wiki for this?

        thetext: "Dear Robert,\n\nApologies for the long delay, I plan to pursue the nirs analyses on a higher tempo coming months, now that I am back at Donders. I would be delighted if you could create a script that converts Homer2 data (.nirs files) into files readable by Fieldtrip. Homer2 does not provide the option of inspecting the data trial-by-trial, and this is particularly important when trying get a grip on what the data looks like, before we start implementing artifact protocols. The babyBRAIN group is very happy with the artifact rejection options of Fieldtrip (e.g., the option of looking at variability between trials and channels etcetera), which another reason for me to prefer Fieldtrip.\n\nTo shortly comment on Jörn suggestion about visualization: Although visualization of the topography of effects over the head would be fancy, it is not essential and can be safely left out. \n\nI have attached a word document containing a description of a .nirs file in general. Furthermore you find attached two Matlab scripts: one for converting nts-system (what we have at DCCN) data into a .nirs file, and one script I used to concretely implement that conversion on an example data set that you can download here:\n\nhttps://www.wetransfer.com/downloads/c54d4be48c4cc4cb95fbe8e1394f25ee20161014105209/98815ebbdc70f05a704b73aa1cec244220161014105209/9551f3\n\nThe link contains a .nirs file (which is the one I hope you can convert to an FT structure) and the raw data from the nts-system, just for in case you are curious how we got from our data to the .nirs file (no dataprocessing steps involved, just shuffling of numbers into different matrices).\n\nBest,\nJanny"

        thetext: "Hi Janny,\n\ngreat to see that there is progress! It would indeed be good to have a nirs-to-fieldtrip wrapper. It is not super simple though, as the nirs-files in general are more condensed and a lot of information that fieldtrip would like has been thrown out, but to a certain degree the conversion should be possible (possibly some ft-functions need to be adapted checking for empty fields, but that should not be a big issue).\nWe have just been at the sfNIRS conference in Paris and I remember that I talked to someone who wrote a .nirs-ft wrapper and I hoped to have convinced him to contribute this to the community. I will try to contact him again and ask for the code. I'll let you know when I know more. \n\nBest,\nJörn"

          Hi Jorn,

          Janny and I are working on this bug. Can you send us a nice and rich example Oxymon file that we can look at (with FT) and include in the test script?

          thanks
          Robert

          Optodetemplates.xml

          I also included the (required) optodetemplates.xml, which determines the (relative) positions of the optodes for the oxy3-file. The oxy3-file has a reference to the optodetemplates.xml, thus it is required to have such a file in order to read in the oxy3-file properly.

          oxy3-file

          I copied the file to /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/original/nirs/artinis and tried this

          filename = dccnpath('/home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/original/nirs/artinis/1102 24 channel_2.oxy3');

          hdr = ft_read_header(filename);
          dat = ft_read_data(filename);
          evt = ft_read_event(filename);

          cfg = [];
          cfg.dataset = filename;
          cfg.viewmode = 'vertical';
          cfg.preproc.demean = 'yes';
          ft_databrowser(cfg);

          but get stuck on the interactive selection of an optode template (which happens in a p-file that I cannot debug any further).
