        thetext: For beamforming time series, it is desirable to implement the unit-noise gain minimum-variance (aka Borgiotti-Kaplan) beamformer and the related neural activity index. The major reason this should happen directly in the beamformer code is that when the optimal orientation is calculated, any such "weight normalization" should be taken into account. (See equation 4.47 in the Sekihara & Nagarajan 2008 book.) This is not feasible to recalculate after the weights are already obtained, but can make a surprisingly dramatic improvement in the source reconstruction quality.

          I think I have resolved this with Pull #133 :-)

          thanks, I just I merged your PR

          Are you planning to look into the trace for vector BFs?

          Yes, I can take care of adding support for vector BF. I was mistaken, the solution is not a trace, but a more complicated formula, so it may take some time for me to write and test it.

          Also a small clarification to my first comment. If a vector beamformer is used, it *is* indeed feasible to compute the optimum orientation at a later stage. :-) But with a scalar beamformer, it must be done upon weight computation.
