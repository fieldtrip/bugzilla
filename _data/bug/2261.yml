          Using ft_specest_hilbert I realize that the ft_preproc_bandpassfilter function inside of the fieldtrip/specest/private folder was quite old (‹r7123) in comparison with the ft_preproc_bandpassfilter inside fieldtrip/preproc. See revision http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=8413

          Could somebody check is the svn autosync feature is working fine please? Might be other functions are affected

          I created a script to check this

          ------

          #!/bin/sh

          FILE1=`tempfile`
          FILE2=`tempfile`

          touch $FILE1
          touch $FILE2

          echo $FILE1
          echo $FILE2

          svn propget autosync `find . -name \*.m` | cut -d ' ' -f 1 > $FILE1
          for LINE in `cat $FILE1` ; do
          basename $LINE >> $FILE2
          done

          for FUNCTION in `cat $FILE2 | sort | uniq` ; do
          unset FIRSTOCCURENCE
          for OCCURENCE in `grep $FUNCTION $FILE1` ; do

          if [ -z "$FIRSTOCCURENCE" ] ; then
          FIRSTOCCURENCE=$OCCURENCE
          fi

          diff -q $FIRSTOCCURENCE $OCCURENCE

          done
          done
          ---------

          Right now (rev 8775) it prints out a long list of files that differ :-(

          Checking the first one,  it seems that the difference is only in the SVN Id line:

          mac001> diff  external/dipoli/ama2vol.m fileio/private/ama2vol.m
          26c26
          < % $Id: ama2vol.m 5036 2011-12-14 10:47:52Z roboos $
          ---
          > % $Id$

          which is not surprising. However, the 2nd one is incorrect, since the svn id is apparently not set at all. This is addressed at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/svn#keeping_the_svn_repository_tidy and I will tidy it up before checking the autosync again.

          However, these are not meant to be the same files, so actually there is no problem. The script was incorrectly comparing them because they match partially with grep.

          I changed the script into

          -------------
          FILE1=`tempfile`
          FILE2=`tempfile`

          touch $FILE1
          touch $FILE2

          echo $FILE1
          echo $FILE2

          find `pwd` -name \*.m\* -not -iwholename '*.svn*' -print | xargs svn propget autosync | cut -d ' ' -f 1 > $FILE1
          for LINE in `cat $FILE1` ; do
          basename $LINE >> $FILE2
          done

          for FUNCTION in `cat $FILE2 | sort | uniq` ; do
          unset FIRSTOCCURENCE
          # there should be a / in front of the filename and the file should be at the end of the line
          for OCCURENCE in `grep \/$FUNCTION$ $FILE1` ; do

          if [ -z "$FIRSTOCCURENCE" ] ; then
          FIRSTOCCURENCE=$OCCURENCE
          fi

          diff -I '\$Id.*\$' -q $FIRSTOCCURENCE $OCCURENCE

          done
          done
          -------------

          With this I was not able to detect any mismatch.
