          Hi Robert
          Just to confirm. It looks to me that the lfs for neuromag grads maybe a factor of 50 out.
          Let me know what you think and if there is anything I can do to help.

          from the list

          1) change grad.pnt into grad.coilpos etc.
          2) add the grad.unit and chanunit according to the present implementation
          3) test all existing code, nothing should ahve changed -> make test script that
          compares old to new
          4) implement support for chanunit in ft_compute_leadfield and ft_convert_units
          5) change the chanunit for the neuromag planar channels from T into T/cm and
          divide the grad.tra by 8 cm

          1) is done
          2) is done for unit, not yet for chanunit
          3) there is the test_bug963 script for this
          4 and 5 not yet done.

          There seem to be two related test scripts that were made by Cristiano.
          - test_bug686 is related to bug 686
          - test_bug1042 is related to bug 1042

          The first one does not crash, but the output does not look very good. It suggests that a change in geometrical units does not translate linearly into a change in leadfield values.

          The second one also does not crash (it is still running), but the comments in the bug report suggest that a change in conductivity does not translate linearly into a change in leadfield values.

          what a mess.

          I have made an initial change to ft_compute_leadfield that allows the user to call it with unit=arbitrary or unit=si. In the latter case, the input is converted into m and the output should be T, T/m or V.

          Committed revision 6834.

          It relies on ft_convert_units, which at this moment is not capable of converting the head model parameters. So for a very simple head models (without params) it works, but for more complex ones it won't.

          I also added a test script. This should be extended.
