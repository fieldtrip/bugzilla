          Discussed in FT-meeting 12/09: the file is 1kb and seems empty.
          Johanna will take care of this one. Hopefully fixed by next meeting....

        thetext: "It appears in the ftp zip because it's also in /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip, even though not under SVN control. \nThe file was added by roboos mrphys on July 14, 2011, and it has only group/global read permissions, thus I cannot delete it.\nI reassign this to Robert."

          the file appeared in ~roboos/fieldtrip/release/trunk

          I have removed it there and expect it to disappear elsewhere as well.
