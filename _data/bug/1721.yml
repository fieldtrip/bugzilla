          this is important for real-time application, because not the complete header information is written at startup, e.g. chanpos is missing. For computing the planar gradient, this information is needed initially (to get a proper tra-matrix)

          A first version of these templates can be easily done by using our test datasets. Has to be checked for completeness though.
          For our CTF275 dataset, we can actually build a complete header/grad structure, because the channels which are deactivate now were active before the last annual service. Just needs to be merged properly.

          the proper merging of the CTF275 grads is actually not that easy. I thought it can just be done by applying some rotation matrix and maybe some translation, but that's not enough sufficient somehow...

          CTFs newCombinedDs will probably also not work here, will it?
