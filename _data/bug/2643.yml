          ft_sourceinterpolate crashes in line 105: Undefined function or variable 'abort'.
          Previous version of fieldtrip (20131231) works fine with the script/parameters used.
          Probably similar to BUG ID 2580.

          In case of bug 2580 it was an error on the users side, i.e. the fieldtrip version that both Ayelet and Yuliya were using on their local computers was corrupt. That is not something we can fix.

          From which location are you using fieldtrip? From your own computer, or from /home/common?

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #1)

          if it is from home common, it might be related to bug 2643. That also does not appear to be fieldtrip error, but a problem with the compute cluster storage.

          My office mate Xu Gong was also experiencing this problem, with basically all FT functions. I fixed it by doing:

          restoredefaultpath
          addpath /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/
          ft_defaults

          and then everything worked again.

          However, I don't really understand the cause, and/or why doing this fixed it.

        thetext: it suggests a temporary corruption in the file system. @Izabela and Xu should report it at the TG (letting the TG know that there was a problem, and that the problem is not there any more).
