          after making the table, we need to identify the problematic cases and discuss them
          - no fieldtrip functions should depend on a compat function
          - all functions should only depend on functions at the same level or below

          What is the goal of tracking the dependencies? I can imagine:
          a) trigger the correct test scripts on modification the functions being tested, AND their dependencies,
          b) identify and clean up legacy dependencies
          c) documentation purposes.

          Did I miss anything?

          I compared the current mex files with the files listed in ft_compile_mex, and found some inconsistencies already:

          src/nanvar.c was not listed
          src/keyval.c does not exist

          The mexfiles were found using:
          $ find . -name "*.c" | xargs grep -l mexFunction | sort

          Maybe we should automatically update the list with mexfiles? The main question would be how and when these files should be updated...

The script checks for dependencies on compat/functions and throws an error if any dependencies on compat are found in non-compat-functions.\n\nIt detected 3 dependencies on compat functions. 2 of those were actual dependencies, on filetype.m instead of ft_filetype.m and were fixed (nice work on automatically checking this!). \nHowever, the 3 dependency is a bit weird. It is listed as a dependency on compat/fieldtripdefs.m, which is called by trunk/fieldtripdefs.m. If I do a which fieldtripdefs -all, it returns trunk/fieldtripdefs as a 'shadow'.\n\nIs this 'shadow' here on purpose? If so, I will add an exception to the test script, ignoring the shadow.

          in general functions should only be present once (either in main, a module or in a compat folder). Note that this is a special case, because fieldtripdefs was called automatically by  all FT functions.

          In this case I suggest to get rid of both functions! People should not be using this any more.
