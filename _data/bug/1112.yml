          the chanpos includes some reference channels, due to which the size is estimated to be in mm instead of cm

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

          The problem disappears when a interdecile range (difference between 10% and 90% percentile) is used to estimate the head size.

          Should this interdecile range (idrange) function be a subfunction, or available more widely within fieldtrip?
