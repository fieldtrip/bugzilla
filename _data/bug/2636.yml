          the idea is to start with the La/Br contour and based on that determine (with the known and fixed electrode spacings) where all electrodes should be.

          What I need to get started with this is the mouse CT scan (preferably in the original dicom format).

          this is not likely ever going to happen.

          For future reference: If it were implemented, it should be in ft_electrodeplacement and not in ft_electroderealign.
