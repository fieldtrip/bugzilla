From now on, the change of the file at one location (i.e. in src) will automatically be synched with the other location (i.e. one of the private locations).\n\nNote that the mex files in @config and in @uint64 should not have the autosync=true option\n\nIf not sure, ask Robert!"

          error of mexing rfbevent in src/

          I only have a Matlab win32 version, I will ask the TG for a 64bit version for my desktop PC.

          abs.c was already mexed for both platforms

          ft_spike_sub_crossx should not be autosynced, should it?

          mexing of rfbevent resulted in an error due to missing files(see attachment)

          Making this windows compatible (either 32 or 64 bit) is quite some work, and I don't think that anyone is waiting for that. I added the following as explicit error message.


          #include "platform.h"
          #include "compiler.h"

          #if defined(PLATFORM_WIN32) || defined(PLATFORM_WIN64)
          #error The source code for this mex file has not yet been made compatible with Windows
          /* the networking include files differ on windows and some of the functions are different */
          /* a possibility to fix this would be to look into the fieldtrip buffer c-code, which is both unix and windows compatible */
          #endif

          -----

          I believe that it is possible to include a list of include/exclude compilation platforms in ft_compile_mex, please exclude this for w32 and w64 in that file.
