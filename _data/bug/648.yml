        thetext: the layoutgui function is defined as subfunction and used in ft_electroderealign/ft_sensorrealign. It seems to me that both functions serve a similar purpose. If that is the case, they should be consolidated into a single function.

          In order to make this work, we need to implement some new hpos and vpos options. Currently, electroderealign adds ui control elements to the righthand side of the figure. In contrast, ft_uilayout features 4 modes for horizontal positioning:
           - an 'auto' mode, which spaces elements 0.01 normalized units apart, starting from the most lefthand side of the figure
           - an 'align' mode, which makes the starting x-position the same for all elements, namely the one from the first element
           - a 'distribute' mode, which distributes all elements equally from the lefthand to the righthand side
           - a number, which makes the starting x-position the same for all elements, namely the number passed on as an argument.

          None of these options allow for an alignment to the righthand side. I could either add an 'halign' option, which could be 'left' or 'right' (or 'centered'). Alternatively, I could add more options for 'hpos', but I'm very much in favour of a separate option. A similar case holds for vertical alignment then ('top' and 'bottom')

          Furthermore, all these options for 'hpos' and 'vpos' are not documented in ft_uilayout, yet. This needs to be done.

          I understand that ft_uilayout now takes over from layoutgui. However, I see that there are still two functions calling layoutgui:

          mac001> grep -l layoutgui *.m */*.m
          ft_interactiverealign.m
          private/prepare_mesh_manual.m

          yup indeed, I just fixed that

          these *realign functions are super weird, they all look the same, they all do the same, have the same callbacks, etc., but still there are three of those. I don't wanna volunteer for that, but I think they should be merged.
          generally I think that the few GUIs that there are receive too little attention and are not always too polished and code is rather scattered, sometimes across different functions. that is a pity, because it is so much work to make interactive functions, and often little is missing to make them really useful...

          thanks!

          Agreed. See bug 1830 for that.
