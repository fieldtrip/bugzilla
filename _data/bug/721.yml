          The rejectvisual_summary function UI seems to suggest that it should be used to *toggle* channels/trials, but as is the display only allows for the *rejection* of trials. This is due to two aspects of the function:
          1) The plots do not show trials/channels that were turned off
          2) The names of the removed trials/channels are not shown until the function is exited and the changes are saved.

          This patch adds the rejected trials back to the plot using a different plot style, so that the user can actually toggle the rejected trials/channels visually. The actual summary plot (the top left one) is redrawn every time without the rejected trials/channels.

        thetext: Thanks for this one. As such the toggle functionality is nice. Yet, the advantage of the old way of displaying was that the scaling of the subplots was adjusted in order to reveal some finer detail. This is useful in case there are trials/channels for which the maximum value is several orders of magnitude bigger than the rest (e.g. squid jumps in meg-sensors, people specifying both meg and eeg channels to be displayed, or both meg gradiometers and magnetometers to be shown).

        thetext: Thanks. I hear the point, and I considered it when submitting the patch. My thought was that people could simply run it twice to actually remove the points from the subpoints (run first time, select, let the function complete, and run again), but that does add work. I figured I'd submit it anyway to generate discussion.

          My suggestion would then be to create a cfg-option (cfg.viewmode = 'remove' (default) or 'mark').

          The 'remove' option will then be old behavior, the 'mark' option will give your suggested behavior.

          What do you think?
