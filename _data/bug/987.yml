        thetext: "First, however, the following:\n\n1) dimlength only recognizes hardcoded fields, (cov, powspctrm), not user specified, e.g. 'stat' which would be common in a 'second level statistic'.\n \nSo in the case I enter a series (becoming the rpt) of datastructures in freqstatistics, all containing dimord = 'chan_freq', with only a .stat field as the data, it cannot infer the dimensionality (i.e. dimlength). However, freqstatistics was called with cfg.parameter = 'stat'. This is however not passed over to dimlength in selectdata.\n\nProblem occurs (recursively) at dimlength line 46 and 116\n\n2) Also, it there are problems swallowing one-dimensional data. Still is high on my wishlist since now i have to add a dimension (_freq) and an extra field (.freq).\n\nPlease let me know if I need to elaborate. \n\nCheers,\nStephen"

        thetext: "As it is now ft_selectdata is a little bit inconsistent when it comes to dealing with out-of-bounds or invalid input parameters. I see how it would be the best one can do considering relaxed use by higher functions, but to give some examples:\n\n- breaks when nonexistent channel is used (perhaps do a check?)\n\n- no errors (or warning) when toilim do not overlap with data.time, but instead returns single timepoint closest to toilim. I.e. if toilim = [-12 -10] but data.time = [-8 0] (as with testdata), it returns data.time = -8 (and corresponding values). \n\n- no errors (or warning) when frequencies do not exist and similar behaviour as with toilim.\n\nAlthough great if you know the behaviour, a user might not e.g. expect a requested toilim out of bounds to be returned with data not from within those limits.\n\nWhat say ye?"
