          1) Add documentation of what cfg options possible.  Seems to me only cfg.channel.

          2) Line 102 says .cov(:,chanselchansel) but should be .cov(:,chansel,chansel).  Very surprising that this bug was introduced in Nov 2011 and no one reported it between then and now!

          3) If timelock structures all have a .trial (and automatically .avg field), then the .avg fields should be removed, a new .trial created based on concatenation over trials (as is done); but then also a new .avg  and new .var should be created based on this new .trial.   Although .avg is not considered a required field for a timelock structure, ft_sourceanalysis requires .avg (although maybe shouldn't?!) even if .trial exists.   Alternatively, the user can compute .avg themself after append prior to sourceanalysis, but should FT require this of them?

          See also bug 1495.
