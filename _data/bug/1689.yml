There seem to be some common file formats that allow data to be passed between them.\n\ne.g. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Graph_Format\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language\n\nThe first one contains a list of other format. GraphViz seems to be widely used, it is also used by other software. \n\nSee http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4518"

        thetext: perhaps call it ft_networkwrite, in line with ft_networkanalysis. There might be some need for shared code between the two, e.g. in data handling and thresholding.

          Not sure whether Georgios' esi e-mail address is still active.

          @G: do you intend to follow up on this? If not, I suggest to close for the time being.
