          .zlim option: 'zeromin' (in documentation) is 'minzero' in the code.

          discovered in UK FT toolkit.

          check other plotting functions as well.

          Actually, it is correct in the documentation of the function itself (help/doc ft_multiplotTFR). It is the reference page on the wiki that has not been updated since June:

          I'm guessing the routine that updates the reference pages has failed again. I'll CC Robert on this one.

        thetext: OK, I just self-assigned it from the e-mail I got without checking whether actually people already have jumped on it. I guess that Jim volunteered to solve this, so I happily hand back the responsibility to him.

          It seems that the reference pages were last updated in September last year as well:
