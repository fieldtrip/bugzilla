        thetext: Gareth sent Robert some functions a while ago to make the single shell model unit-free. I didn't want to check them in because there might be side effects on Donders users. I attach them again. Please see if they can be incorporated and let us know.

          Hi Vladimir,

          This was actually also on my list to fix, but I did not get to it yet. I didn't know Gareth was on it as well. Probably Robert did not yet manage to go through the pile of e-mails after his holiday. Could you send the files to me then I'll have a look at it.

          JM
