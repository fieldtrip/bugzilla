          Hey guys,

          I'm pretty sure that ft_freqgrandaverage is giving the wrong number of subjects in its feedback. It's saying 'computing average powspctrm over [n-1] subjects' instead of [n] subjects.

          Just noticed now on mentat.

          I don't *think* that the output GA structure itself is wrong, just the feedback.
