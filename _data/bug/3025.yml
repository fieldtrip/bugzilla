        thetext: This is hard-coded in the function. In principle it's OK, but I would suggest to relax this a bit, and allow the function to run through if a headmodel is specified (rather than a sens). As I see it, a geometry is needed to define the grid boundary. This shouldn't necessarily be the sensor positions, but could be the headmodel (after some outward shift. This came up when somebody was working with the (under construction) sourcemodel tutorial.

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #0)

          the sensor array based inside detection was used for MEG local spheres, where the set of spheres itself was not appropriate for inside/outside detection.

          Ah, there's the dinosaur in the closet...
          Right now, my change will lead to a crash if someone puts a T-rex in the cfg, before it wouldn't have worked either, so nothing lost yet.
          I'll update.
