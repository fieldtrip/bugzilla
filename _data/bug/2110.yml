        thetext: "I originally had (15) long trials (150 seconds) that each had partial artifact rejections, resulting in many (90) shorter trials which may or may not include the trigger event.  So when I tried to run a spike-triggered average on a time window around the trigger (just happened to be the first thing I tried, don't know if other analyses will have the same problem), it seems to get confused about which trials to use, eventually throwing this error:\n\n>> processing trial 15 of 90 (16 spikes)\n>> Index exceeds matrix dimensions.\n\n>> Error in ft_spiketriggeredaverage (line 157)\n>>   spikesmp = find(data.trial{i}(spikesel,:));\n\nIt turns out that the line\n\n>> data = ft_selectdata(cfgSelect,data);\n\ncorrectly cut the data down to the subset of 15 trials that contained the trigger event and desired latencies, but the loop\n\n>> for i=1:ntrial\n\nis still based on the original number of (90) trials.  I also tried preselecting those trials by listing their indices in cfg.trials, but it gave the exact same error, since ntrial is defined by \n\n>> ntrial = length(data.trial);\n\nbefore ft_selectdata is called.  I imagine that's probably the fix:  just redefine ntrial again after ft_selectdata.\n\nThanks,\nTeresa"

          Hi Teresa

          You are right. This is something of a recent release, I guess, because I didn't see this selectdata piece of code before.

          I'll correct it.
