I will ask for the team to look it over before committing of course.

          > 8) new output field of .usetrial

          I don't understand why you'd want this. We also don't have it for all other functions that have cfg.trials as selection. For interpreting the average, you don't have to know which trials went into its computation. And if you want to know what was done to get the results that were represented in the output structure, you can look in timelock.cfg and previous....

          This seems the same as the discussion we had this afternoon on whether we should store the covlatency window in the output (which we also don't do).


          > 9) if trialinfo isfield, then save trialinfo(usetrial)

          but only if keeptrials=yes.

          > 1) error if cfg.latency isfield (checkconfig)

          In further discussion (for sake of consistency across all functions to have a .latency input) the names will now be cfg.latency and cfg.covlatency

          > 3) if neither of (2) is specified, use maxperlength

          maxperlength will be for .latency but minperlength for .covlatency [Since point (7) says to ignore trials for cov-computation that don't have all time points in the window.  This is consistent with current implementation where a trial is thrown out for covariance computation if does not have all points inside specified time window.]

          > 6) make sure vartrllength=0 crashes only after check if required latency is
          > present for all trials (maybe already there)

          deprecate vartrllength.  for 'avg', behaviour will be like vartrllength=2, for 'cov', it will be like vartrllength=1.


          > 8) new output field of .usetrial

          agree with Robert's comment: timelock.cfg.trials is sufficient

          > 9) if trialinfo isfield, then save trialinfo(usetrial)

          agree with Robert's comment: only if keeptrials='yes'
