        thetext: The problem likely started when the dashboard was created. All those script reports do not have links to them, so there is a huge amount of orphans. This is why PHP's maximum memory was exhausted. I now patched the problem by increasing the maximum memory size per script execution to 256MB (from 128MB). I will now try to find a way to filter out the dashboard scripts from the orphans list.

        thetext: I have now excluded development:dashboard:- and reference:-pages from the orphans reports. The problems page still loads rather slowly, but I think this is the best we can do, without rewriting the whole plugin.
