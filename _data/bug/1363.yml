        thetext: "After I run 1 subject (possibly with multiple calls to ft_artifact_zvalue) it works fine.\nI 'close all' and 'clear all global' and delete(h) any remaining figures.\nThen I load the data for the second subject.\nThen the subplots don't plot the data in the interactive GUI of ft_artifact_zvalue.  The reason is that on line 853, get(opt.h2,'children') is not empty.\nClosing out Matlab and restarting solves it.  \n\nIs this a bug, or an unsolvable Matlab weirdness, or is there some other command I can use to clear hidden variables?"

        thetext: I ran my analysis pipeline quite often the last weeks, in which multiple calls to ft_artifact_zvalue occur for each subject. I never encountered the error you get. However, I never close all or clear all global - did you try without these calls?

          Hi Joern, thanks for this info.
          I tried it again, with only doing 'clear all', and then it worked fine to load the next subject.
          I had actually been calling 'nut_fresh' which has this in it:
          clear all;
          try
              close all hidden;
          end
          clc;
          set(0,'ShowHiddenHandles','on');
          delete(get(0,'Children'));

          So maybe something there was doing it.  Works for me.
