I think someone else has since added the note/warning at an appropriate place, linking to http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/common_filters_in_beamforming  which shows some nice example scripts.  I think this is sufficient for a general user, but for the purpose of a toolkit, is this annoying?  Should the main tutorial still be remade to include 'common filters'? \n\n3) Another idea I had to add would be on how to use beamforming with timedomain LCMV.  Should this be included in this tutorial, or as a separate 'example'?"

One way is\n\na) activity divided by estimated noise\nb) activity divided by baseline\nc) activity1 divided by activity2\n\nIn case b and c you can make the H0 that the data in both conditions is the same, and that therefore the best spatial filter is constructed is on the two conditions copmbined (common). That common filter is then applied separately to each condition. \n\nNote that the alternative for \"a\" is to use normalized leadfields. That is something to consider to put in the tutorial.\n\nRe 3: would be nice to have it in this tutorial, but don't know whether it works well on this data. The stimuli  are auditory presented words.

          start with updating the test_tutorial_beamformer (which then will automatically update the figures) and fill in the tutorial text around it.

          When looking at this with Cristiano last week, it seemed more that it was a relative deep blob in occipital cortex, i.e. deep but quite shifted from the apparent center-of-head in the original depth bias picture. So it might be more physiological than only depth bias. But nai indeed appears better.

          I updated test_tutorial_beamformer.m to show that line of code for volumereslice.

          Still wondering: Does it matter what the filename of the saved source output is? Especially as there are now two (NAI and common filter output)?

        thetext: file names for saved source output is now consistent with the test_tutorial_beamformer and the wiki, and the files have been given to Robert to copy to the ftp/data directory.
