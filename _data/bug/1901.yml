          HI Vladimir
          Gareth writing from Tom#s machine.
          Tom is using the custom head model.

          So starting with
          cfg =

              reducerank: 2
                    grad: [1x1 struct]
                 channel: {274x1 cell}
                     vol: [1x1 struct]
                    grid: [1x1 struct]
                feedback: 'off'
             inwardshift: 0

          where
          cfg.grid.resolution=5
          cfg.vol=
              bnd: [1x1 struct]
             type: 'nolte'
             unit: 'mm'

          grid  = ft_prepare_leadfield(cfg);

          we get only 10 dipoles in the grid.
          Changing gridstep to .05 (instead of 5) however and we get 9980.
          Is it possible that the units on the input to ft_prepare_leadfield have
          changed since the last release ?

          Yes, that sounds like something that has to do with changes in units.
          I'm CCing Robert as in principle he's aiming to maintain backward
          compatibility and prevent this kind of things from happening so the
          exact reason is worth investigating. I hope there are no related
          problems for MSP and VB-ECD

          bugfix - the sourcemodel units were always converted to cm, also if the vol and grad input were in mm and cfg.sourceunits was not specified. This caused a problem for spm, see http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=1901. Fixed and made a test script.
