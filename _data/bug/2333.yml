        thetext: "Hello everyone,\n\nI am working with a MNE file ('.fif'), and I wanted to convert it in an appropiate format in Fieldtrip, so I followed this tutorial : \n\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/getting_started/neuromag\n\nThe first step worked withouth problem, but when I tried to use ft_read_data, the next error appeared:\n\nReference to non-existent field 'iscontinuous'.\n\nError in ft_read_data (line 898)\n\nGoing into that line , we can see\n\nif (hdr.orig.iscontinuous)\n      dat = fiff_read_raw_segment(hdr.orig.raw,begsample+hdr.orig.raw.first_samp-1,endsample+hdr.orig.raw.first_samp-1,chanindx);\n      dimord = 'chans_samples';\n    elseif (hdr.orig.isaverage)\n\n\n\nSo, it seemed that there were no iscontinous, so looking into ft_read_header, if we go to the line  1413-1419 , we have the following:\n\n% remember the original header details\n    hdr.orig = info;\n    \n    % these are useful to know in ft_read_event\n    hdr.info.isaverage    = isaverage;\n    hdr.info.iscontinuous = iscontinuous;\n\nIf we compare it, we can see that iscontinuous has different references, orig and info, so what I did is change in ft_read_data orig for info, and it worked. Just wanted to inform you all.\n\nRegards!"

          merde, my bad!

          I made that change only 1 or two days ago (renamed orig into info), and apparently did not think well enough about the consequences.
