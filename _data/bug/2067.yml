        thetext: "Hi all,\n\nI found that in the latest version of FT (@ DCCN \"H:\\common\\matlab\\fieldtrip\" used today on 18th of March 2013), the function ft_prepare_headmodel doesn't do the automatic conversion from mm to cm for a 'ctf' layout. It says in the tutorial that it should do that, and also in an earlier version of FT ('fieldtrip-20120222') it did do the conversion. \nNow you end up with sensor locations in cm and brain volume in mm.\n\nBest,\n\nErik te Woerd"

          Hi Erik

          Do you have a small script and/or mat file that demonstrates it (and shows your usage)?

          Thanks

          SegmentedMRI (output of ft_volumesegment)

          This is then the next step (this should do the automatic conversion from mm to cm):

          % Create head model

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method='singleshell';
          vol = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, segmentedmri);

          Hi Erik,

          the conversion does not take place, because the segmentedmri is in 'mm' and FieldTrip nowadays does not do unnecessary/arbitrary conversions but keeps the input units. The 'beamformer' tutorial is not explicit about this, but explicitly defines the leadfield computation with cfg.grid.unit = 'cm'. The 'beamformingextended' tutorial explicitly mentions that the headmodel needs to be converted from 'mm' to 'cm' if you want to plot it together with the sensor positions.
          Probably it was a lack of communication from our side leading to this inconsistency from earlier to newer FT versions, sorry for that. At least, it might be good for you to know that we will keep it that and that ft_convert_units is the way to transform to other units :)
