          at this moment it uses "load", i.e. it assumes that the surface and inflated surface are in a mat file. Better would be to use ft_read_headshape, and thereby support also freesurfer, gifti and other cortical sheet file formats (and of course *.mat as well).



          around line 935 there is now

          if ~isempty(cfg.surfinflated)
              % read the inflated triangulated cortical surface from file
              tmp = load(cfg.surfinflated, 'bnd');
              surf = tmp.bnd;
              if isfield(surf, 'transform'),
                % compute the surface vertices in head coordinates
                surf.pnt = warp_apply(surf.transform, surf.pnt);
              end
            end
          end

          this needs to be updated. There will be a similar piece for cfg.surf, i.e. the non-inflated surface.

        thetext: note that in the cfg to ft_sourceplot you now can also put in a surface description directly, not only the string that refers to the surface file.
