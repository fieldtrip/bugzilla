        thetext: Performing a statistical analysis with cfg.statistic = 'roc' doesn't work correctly anymore. It seems that ft_getuserfun selects a default Matlab toolbox function 'roc' instead of the Fieldtrip function  'ft_statfun_roc'. This worked fine some time ago.

          Come to think of it, this might be intended behaviour. If a function with the specified name exists on your path, that function will be used, instead of trying to prepend 'ft_statfun_' to the function name you specify.

          Discussion about this is needed in the FT meeting. In the meantime, you can simply specify cfg.statistic = 'ft_statfun_roc' and everything should work as it used to.

          (In reply to comment #2)
          We discussed in the FT meeting that the problem is caused by namespace conflict (roc is probably part of a matlab toolbox), and that in this case, the full name of the function should be used. Therefore, there is no need for change on the code.
