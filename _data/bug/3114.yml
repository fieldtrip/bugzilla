          *A user pointed out (in an aspecific way) that beamformer with FEM model sometimes recalculates the forward model, and therefore takes too long. This apparently was frustrating the user a lot. We could not replicate the problem on site but I think it might be interesting to know anyway.

        thetext: Due to the lack of suggestions for improvement, I would assume that there is nobody who is able to fix this anytime soon. In order to diminish a bit the large heap of filed bugs which will not be addressed anytime soon, I suggest to close for now.
