        thetext: this suggests that the openmeeg binaries run on some torque execution nodes, but fail on some other nodes. This is not a matlab error, but an error in the torque configuration.

          it still fails sporadically, the last time on dcc-c007. However, it is not an openmeeg binary problem, but an assertion ("smaller than eps difference") error. There seems to be some randomness that causes the error to fluctuate just around eps.

          I increased the threshold in the assertino from eps into 10*eps
