          Something to consider. I think it would be nicer than squished pixels, given that typically the MRI voxels are isotropic. It is very easily achieved by adding after line 750:

            set(h1,'DataAspectRatio',[1 1 1]);
            set(h2,'DataAspectRatio',[1 1 1]);
            set(h3,'DataAspectRatio',[1 1 1]);

        thetext: "first of all I don't share your opinion that \"typically voxels are isotropic\". They are isotropic after ft_reslice, but usually the within-slice and between-slice resolution are just slightly different. I don't consider isotropic to be typical. But that is not the issue.\n\nYour change http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=8634&path=/trunk/ft_sourceplot.m\nintroduces a regression error in test_bug1527. The problem is that you assume data.transform to be available at a place in the code where it is not guaranteed to exist.\n\nYour change is at line 716. \n\nI think the data does not have a transform, because it is technically not a 3-D \"volume\" array but a \"source\" structure with more complex dimord. However, it is possible from the n-D dimord to select something that can be reshaped into a 3-D array that can be plotted with ortho.\n\nCould you make a test script with the following cases\n\n1) isotropic volume, nicely aligned with axes\n2) non-isotropic volume, nicely aligned with axes\n3) isotropic volume, not aligned with axes\n4) non-isotropic volume, not aligned with axes\n5) isotropic source structure (e.g. with one frequency), not aligned with axes\n6) non-isotropic source structure (e.g. with one frequency), not aligned with axes\n\nand see whether they all run through?"

        thetext: Marking this as resolved since the mentioned regression is fixed. Creating the mentioned test script does not seem directly related to this particular bug.
