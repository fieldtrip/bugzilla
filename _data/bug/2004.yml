          working with Alex Backus on a tighter integration with source level data obtained with 'pcc' as method.

          -inventorise whether it works:
          *which methods?
          *why doesn't it work for some methods?
          *fix it.

          @Stan: I changed the behavior of ft_connectivity_powcorr_ortho, so that the two correlation coefficients (orthogonalising w.r.t. one or the other) are averaged. Perhaps we may discuss the necessity for this to begin with.

          At the moment the test script seems to run through just fine.

          it checks for coh powcorr amplcorr and powcorr_ortho.

          Closing for now.
