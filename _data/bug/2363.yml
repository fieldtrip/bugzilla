          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 8717.

          The problem seems to occur when data.label is a column vector and cfg.channel is a row vector.

          (In reply to comment #1)
          cfg.channel does not matter, when data.label is a column the bug occurs.

          The problem is caused because when all(size(data.label) == size(data.powspctrm)) the label field is added to 'datfields' and thus the makeselection() subfunction will perform the selection in the label field, causing the subsequent makeselection_chan() subfunction to fail (index out of bounds).

          Proposed solution: explicitly exclude .label, .time, and .freq fields from being added to datfields. This seems to me a more robust solution (given the current code) than allowing the selection in these descriptive fields being made by makeselection() already.
