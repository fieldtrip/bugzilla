        thetext: "Came up on the mailinglist again, though I think we discussed this before. Wouldn't be a bad idea. I couldn't find a bug immediately so I thought I'd make one for the sake of remembering it. Maybe start small with a cfg.verbose option in some main functions. Easiest way I can think of now would be to implement this in ft_progress. If we do, all disp/sprintf statements would have to go via ft_progress. \n\nOptions could be:\ncfg.verbose = 'no'\ncfg.verbose = 'yes'\ncfg.verbose = 'very'\nWhere for most functions 'yes' would equal 'very'. 'very' could be useful when putting together a pipeline or so, when as much fieldtrip-output as possible is desired (e.g. every iteration, more statistics of algorithms, etc)."
