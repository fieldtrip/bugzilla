          Well, it seems that the units in the input MRI are not pushed through correctly, right?

          Can you look into this Roemer?

        thetext: "No, it's a bit more complicated I think. Before the MRI is passed to spm functions, it is transformed again to mm at line 279. This is done correctly (verified with ft_sourceplot). \nThe units of this converted mri are then later (line 426) correctly passed through to the output segmentedmri, being mm's.\nHowever, for some reason, after all the spm segmentation, the units are actually in cm's again. (verified with ft_sourceplot). \n\nPerhaps it lies somewhere in the transform matrix not being correctly converted in any of these ft_convert_units steps."

        thetext: sqrt(sum(mri.transform(1:3,1:3).^2)) will give a clue as to the units. If you have  a 1 mm voxel-spaced volume, if it's in mm you should get 1, if it's in cm you should get 0.1

        thetext: "Ah, gotcha. At line 278 the input mri.transform is saved as original.transform (being cm in this case). This is later put back into the output segmentedmri. However, the units are not saved. The units that are put in the output segmentedmri are those of the converted mri (for spm processing), which is always in mm. \n\nI can save the original unit, and put it back later with the original transform. That should solve it. However, there's an isfield on mri.unit at line 426...\nThere are cases when the input mri did not have units? Or is this a deprecated case? If not, perhaps we can do something like this.\n\nCheck if input mri had units, if so, save transform, coordsys and unit at line 277 in original.transform etc. Then, if orginal was not empty, put back all 3 fields in the output segmentedmri. If original is empty, use these fields from the converted mri (generated at line 280)."

          I guess the cleanes fix would be:

          at the top of the function:

          if ~isfield(mri, 'unit')
          mri = ft_convert_units(mri);
          end

          inputunit = mri.unit;



          at the bottom of the function:

          segmentedmri = ft_convert_units(segmentedmri, inputunit);

        thetext: "Ah, I see now that my assertion is not true (sorry for the quick updates ;)).\nI see that ft_convert_units tries to automatically determine the units if they are not present. So it's possible they were not present before the call to ft_volumesegment. \n\nI changed it a bit. If no units are present, it will try to determine them automatically by mri = ft_convert_units(mri), and then use it later on. \n\nIt seems pretty safe now, I'll commit the changes.\n\n(mid-air collision there, but we ended up with the same idea :))\n\nI didn't add the conversion at the bottom, as the transform, coordsys and units are now saved and added back, so there is no need for it."
