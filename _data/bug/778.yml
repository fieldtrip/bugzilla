        thetext: The modification of sensor's scale seems to not work in ft_databrowser when one want to plot MEG and EEG channels together. Using only data with unique type of sensors (only with MEG channels or only with EEG channels) doesn't work neither. One can change the scale with the GUI but not when one uses 2 types of sensor (i.e. MEG and EEG).

          We restrucured the code of the databrowser and temporarily called that function ft_databrowser_new. Dould you please try out ft_databrowser_new and see whether that problem remains?

Dould you please try out ft_databrowser_new and see whether\n> that problem remains?\n\nHi Jorn,\n\nI tried with ft_databrowser_new and I get the same problem. In both ft_databrowser and ft_databrouwser_new I only see the use of cfg.megscale or cfg.eegscale into the subfunction redraw_cb but not in the main code (that's it, before the all subfunctions). If I'm right, redraw_cb only works in the ft_databrowser's GUI and I would expect the use of the cfg.*scale information before the use of the GUI.\n\n\nI do this:\n\n[chNum,X,Y,Width,Height,Lbl,Rem] = textread('CTF151.lay','%f %f %f %f %f %q %q');\n\nLbl=Lbl(1:3:151,:);\n\n\nfor elec = 1:size(eog.label,1)\n    Lbl(end+1,:)= eog.label(elec);%here there're EEG057 and EEG058, my  EOGchannels\nend\n\n\nmeog = ft_appenddata([], meg, eog);\n\n\ncfg                             = [];\ncfg.continuous                  = 'no';\ncfg.trl                         = eog.cfg.trl;\ncfg.viewmode                    = 'vertical';\ncfg.channel                     = Lbl;\ncfg.eegscale                    = 4e-5;\ncfg.megscale                    = 1e-15;\nartif                           = ft_databrowser_new(cfg,meog);"

          Hi Jorn,

          The scale thing seems to appear again. This is my input(attached one trial data toy example):

          cfg                   = [];
          cfg.continuous        = 'no';
          cfg.ploteventlabels   = 'type=value';
          cfg.trl               = ft_findcfg(meog.cfg,'trl');
          cfg.viewmode          = 'vertical';
          cfg.megscale          = 1e-13;
          cfg.eegscale          = 5e-8;
          artif                 = ft_databrowser(cfg,meog);

          The wierd thing is that I checked if the scale multiplication is done (line 1410 and 1426) and it's the case..

          By the way, the cfg.ploteventlabels doesn't work because I cannot see the triggers in the browser

          Hi Diego,

          It works fine in your example data if I use these settings:
          cfg.megscale = 1e8
          cfg.eegscale = 4e1
          The data is multiplied with the number in cfg.xxxscale, not divided. So in your case the difference between the eeg/meg was increased instead of decreased.

          Hey Diego,

          Ah, this I can replicate. It turns out something is going wrong in determining which channels are MEG channels because of using only a subset of channels. I made a new bug out of this, bug 1701, and added you as cc. I don't know of a way to circumvent this yet atm.

          *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 1701 ***
