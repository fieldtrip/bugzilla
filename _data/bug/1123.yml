          within ft_volumenormalise the following fields are added to the cfg: cfg.final and cfg.spmparams.
          These are subsequently removed in the postamble concerned with the cfg tracking (if the trackconfig is set to cleanup).

          We should either change the order of the steps (i.e. first trackconfig and then appending the new fields,

          or

          we should consider to bring the final transformation matrix to a higher level in the output structure (according to fieldtrip philosophy).

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.
