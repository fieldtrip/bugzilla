          From Marco Vuiatti (FieldTrip list):

          Dear Fieldtrippers,

          I have a problem with ft_neighbourplot.

          Data from Neuromag 306 channels. Running on Linux 64 bits, Matlab version 7.12.0

          Neighbours in the Fieldtrip layout seem ok to me.

          However, when plotting them with ft_neighbourplot, the layout is
          clearly incorrect, it includes only about one third of the channels
          and when clicking on single channels, the output is incorrect (it
          always displays the same channel labels).

          I think this is a very useful command, so I would like to be able to use it!

          Below I have copied the corresponding commands.

          Am I doing anything wrong? Any help?

          Thanks

          Marco

          Fix was provided by Mark Noordenbos:

          Hi Jörn,

          Sorry, I just found a small typo in the script.

          I think line 195 of ft_neighbourplot of should be
          str = sprintf('%s, ', cfg.neighbours(curSensId).neighblabel{:});

          Best,
          Mark
