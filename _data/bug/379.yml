          In ft 20110110, I just noticed a couple problems in the ft_freqanalysis help text.

          1) 'wltconvol' on line 21 should be 'wavelet'

          2) the 'OR' on line 89 should be placed between foi and foilim (on line 88)

          3) not a problem per se (or maybe it's only a problem with my understanding :), but is there any chance that more information could be provided regarding the differences between the output options (on the wiki would be great)? to be more specific, I don't know what difference computing fourier makes versus computing pow. (the tutorials all still only have 'pow' as the output option)

          Thanks,
          Matt

          Hi Matt,
          Thanks for the report, documentation has been fixed. As for the output, power is computed by taking the Fourier coefficients squared, followed by a scaling factor. Maybe there is a broader discussion in a wiki tutorial somewhere. I'll look into it, maybe we can find a spot where it warrants a detailed discussion.

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
