          Hi,

          I have discovered that the problem that is shown in the tutorial page:

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/minimum_norm_estimate_in_fieldtrip

          at Figure 5. is probably due to the problem with the volume conductor. On the figure, the sourcespace looks to be larger than the volume conductor.

          I looked at the volume conductor that I used for creating the figure and I have discovered that there parts at the top of the head that are missing. You can check this with the roboos/data/lilmag/tutorial vol7 structure. Other version of the volume conductor (vol6) looks to be ok (no parts are missing).

          I  made a test. When I used the following script to do the segmentation:

          cfg = [];
          cfg.coordsys = 'ctf';
          cfg.smooth    = 5;
          cfg.threshold = 0.5;
          seg7 = ft_volumesegment(cfg, mrirs5);

          cfg = [];
          vol7 = ft_prepare_singleshell(cfg, seg7);

          I got the bad volume conductor, but when I did the following:

          cfg = [];
          cfg.coordsys = 'ctf';
          %cfg.smooth    = 5;
          %cfg.threshold = 0.5;
          seg6 = ft_volumesegment(cfg, mrirs5);


          save seg6 seg6

          cfg = [];
          vol6 = ft_prepare_singleshell(cfg, seg6);

          The vol6 was OK. The difference is that I haven't used the smooth and threshold parameters for the segmentation.

          The question is if there is way to do the segmentation that I get a brainmask but I also can create the volume conductor out of the same variable.

          You can find all these variables in the mentioned directory.

          thanks for help.

          Hi Lilla,

          Good detective work. I think I will ensure/enforce sensible options in ft_volumesegment to prevent people from specifying nonsense cfg's ( ;o) ). It seems the function just needs to allow/disallow certain cfg-options.

          BW,

          JM

But I still have to the question if I have to run two times ft_volumesegment if I want to have a skull stripped anatomy and also a structure that I can input to ft_prepare_singleshell?\n\nlilla"

          can't you do something like

          cfg.output = {'skullstrip' 'brain'}

          prior to calling ft_volumesegment?

          I thought this gives you the skullstripped anatomy, as well as the brain mask
