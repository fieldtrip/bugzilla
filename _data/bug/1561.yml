          The problem becomes strongly visible when analyzing a signal with a spike/dirac pulse at the last sample. The sample will be 'pushed' out of the signal by the forward filter, while not being pushed back in. As a solution we implemented a two-pass reverse and a two-pass average solution. Two-pass reverse first applies the reverse filter, then the forward filter. Two-pass average will apply both twopass and twopass-reverse and then take the average, i.e. it edge effects will be averaged. Averaged should really be taken in a literal sense, meaning that we will get a /\ like effect. See ft_testbug1561 for this.

          Also see bug 1318 which deals with implementing more padding options (pad the mirrored signal).
