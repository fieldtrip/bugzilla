          commit 0788559456f11cfd01cd9d64eace59df9831a078
          Author: Robert Oostenveld <>
          Date:   Sun Mar 17 15:16:24 2013 +0100

              enhancement - improved channel handling in case of config object, see #2061

          commit 68b4c3c4698c341174533e9511eb53ea634f0709
          Author: Robert Oostenveld <>
          Date:   Sun Mar 17 15:15:01 2013 +0100

              enhancement - instead of giving an error, give a warning when non-unique channels are present and discard them. See also #2061

          test_bug2059 was simply due to not finding the mat file with the test data

          fixed.

          test_bug1129 has to do with filtering, which I have also been working on :-(

          Error using filter_with_correction (line 44)
          Calculated filter coefficients have poles on or outside the unit circle and will not be stable. Try a higher cutoff freque
          type/order of filter.
          Error in ft_preproc_bandpassfilter (line 128)
            filt = filter_with_correction(B,A,dat,dir);
          Error in test_bug1129 (line 217)

          (In reply to comment #6)

          this is not due to the instabilityfix, but due to the change in the organization of the signal processing toolbox functions

          >> which butter
          /opt/matlab2012b/toolbox/signal/signal/butter.m

          >> addpath ~/matlab/fieldtrip-git/external/signal/
          >> which butter
          /home/mrphys/roboos/matlab/fieldtrip-git/external/signal/butter.m

          With the mathworks signal/butter I get the error, with the replacement butter I don't get it. So apparently the two implementations are not identical.

          contains all the commits that I made in git and merged into svn. That was not what I had in mind, as you cannot see the details any more. Well, hopefully the dashboard shows some improvements.
