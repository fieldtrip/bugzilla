          I found in this section, the comments refered to 'fully incongruent' when actually this is the 'fully congruent' condition.  I fixed it.

          Is this what the participant meant?

        thetext: I also found that avgFIC.fsample no longer exists as a field, when running the current version, but it appears on the wiki that it should be there.  I removed that line on the wiki.

          I indeed think that that was what the participant meant.
          thanks!
