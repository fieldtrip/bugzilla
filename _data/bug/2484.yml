        thetext: "I demonstrated it to Tineke and discussed it with her. Some problems encountered/realized:\n\n- data.cfg.previous can be a cell-array\n- fields can be a struct-array, like data.cfg.event\n- data.hdr.orig is also potentially identifiable\n\nRight now the function maintains two lists: keep and remove, and one option for realing with unknown fields (i.e. usually ask). When asking, it prints\n\nShould this field be (k)ept, (r)emoved, [K]eep all, [R]emove all? \n\nbetter is to implement it as\n[k]eep   the field this time only, ask again for the next occurrence\n[r]emove the field this time only, ask again for the next occurrence\n[K]eep   the field from now on, don't ask again\n[R]emove the field from now on, don't ask again\n\nThe consequence of k and r would be that it is placed on the \"ask\" list, i.e. rather than having a cfg.uncertain option with string values, it should have three lists: keep, remove and ask."

          Sending        ft_anonimizedata.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 9376.

          Major rewrite of core functionality, added a tabular GUI to get an improved overview. The function seems to be working as expected and removes the desired fields.

          The only thing that I feel remains to be done is to ask for end-user feedback and incorporate that in the help. In the mean time, I'll be able to use it as it is.
