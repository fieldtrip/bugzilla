          I think it would make sense to have a documentation section at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/reading_data, i.e. main menu -> user documentation -> importing your data.

          That is where other "special" types of data are also listed.

          The page can be short, but should contain the following sections

          **Eyelink and MEG**
          "At the DCCN we record ... ADC channels ...."

          **Eyelink and EEG**
          "it is possible to record ... ExG ..., however at the DCCN we record them separately. Hence ... (explain how to synchronize) ..."

          **Eyelink on its own**
          Explain how to read the asc data and deal with stimulus presentation events etc.

          Hi Alina,
          I'm going to improve the eyelink data analysis in fieldtrip and it'd help me a lot if you can share with us EEG+eyetracker data (one block will be enough). The idea is to adapt fieldtrip to the following data situations (see Robert's comment):

          **Eyelink and MEG** (I can use my data)

          **Eyelink and EEG** (Alina?)

          **Eyelink on its own** (I can use my data)

        thetext: "(In reply to Diego Lozano Soldevilla from comment #4)\n\nLong discussion with Robert about how eyetracker data should be represented in Fieldtrip. He came out with the idea to represent (micro)saccades as spike data structures. First approach would be to create a \"ft_saccade_detection\" function identifying (micro)saccades similarly as in ft_spike_detection. Adapting the general rationale behing the spike representation we would be in a position to do compute classic (micro)saccades analysis as:\n\n- Peristimulus saccade histograms locked to the stimuli. This would be an adaptation from ft_spike_psth/ft_spike_plot_raster (i.e. figure 5a here http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903000841). It's also interesting to have a look to ft_datatype_segmentation function to get an idea about how to represent number with strings attached to them: i.e. left eye vertical channel as string and the ocurrence (time) of the microsaccades\n\n- Eye movement classification. I discussed together with Jarrod Dowdall (Fries lab) our plans to develop basic rutines for eye movement detection. He has a lot of expertise that wouldn't mind to share with us. He explained me how to classify eyemovements using different features as position, velocity, acceleration, peak-to-peak microsaccade... A first approach would be to develop a function in line with ft_spike_waveform to classify saccades with a PCA+kmeans on velocity vs amplitude plots (see Figure 2 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903000841)\n\n- Think about how data convertions could and should occur.\nBigger picture:\nWe can analyze: a) continuous data: electrophysiological/eyemovement recordings\n                b) events: triggers/stimuli we use to synchronize paradigm and recordings\n                c) spike/(micro)saccades: especial events the we'd generate by data analysis of recordings. Can be viewed as:\n1) \"events/triggers\" to timelock your continuous recordings\n2) Discrete events that can be analyze by its own as the spikes or eye movements\n                d) artifact: they mark the begining and the end of an event in time samples. \n\nWe should think in ways to combine and convert this 4 different data representations to exploit data analysis. \n\nIn some settings, the eyetracker-to-electrophysiological analysis could be more challenging. For example when the eyetracker sampling rate is slower than the MEEG sampling rate. We could adopt strategies as for the spike field coherence analysis that Robert, Thilo and Martin worked previously. In future, we could adopt the same analysis strategy to analyze rat movement recordings (slow sampling rate) with spike/fields as the place-field people do"

        thetext: "Which function does the Fieldtrip use to parse the eye tracking data?\n\nIf I use ft_definetrial and ft_preprocessing to read trials from the eyelink file, it creates a standard data structure with trials and everything else. But it also has fields data.hdr.orig where it stores the eyelink messages. \n\nFor example, data.hdr.orig.sfix contains timestamps of fixation start as computed by the eyelink, data.hdr.orig.efix contains eyelink timestamps of fixation start, fixation end, duration and velocity, data.hdr.orig.msg contains miscellaneous messages (calibration data, stimulus onset time etc)\n\nHere is a file with preprocessed data so that you can have a look at it:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/9b5uyfu9j6t9hea/gcoSeFvJxH\n\nI would like to know which function pulls this information about saccades and fixations from the eyelink data file. Right now those numbers are stored as text strings and are partially concatenated, but it would be more useful to store them in an array. I know that you are working on your own algorithm for saccade detection, but while it's not there, I could also use the one implemented in Eyelink."

          Hi Alina,
          This is indeed a very good point. See Bug 2525. The function you're looking for is fieldtrip/fileio/private/read_eyelink_asc.m. I'll do my best to solve it out soon

          Progress and outline:

          - New function comming: ft_detect_movement
          It'll be not only useful for micro/saccade detection but also for more general purpose analysis concerning velocity changes. Joystic data, rat position (place-grid cell experiments), MEG head movements...

          - Its output will be a Nx3 matrix. The first and second columns will specify the
          begin and end samples of the thresholded velocity event (microsaccade, joystic movement...), and the third column will contain the peak velocity. This last thrid column might be relevant in some data representation to make a conversion. For example will allow to convert the micro/saccades from artifact to spike data representation. All relevant spike functions should be fully compatible to microsaccades expressed as spikes

          - Create FT_PLOT_MOVEMENT based on ft_plot_vector: Jorn will join the party!
