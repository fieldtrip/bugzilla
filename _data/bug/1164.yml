          Created attachment 187
          Mail from R. Oostenveld

          When running rda2ft.exe (with the parameters localhost and 51244) it throws an error:
          "Unrecognized packet type (10000), has size 24 - exiting"

          Connection seems to work, so I assume that the streaming of data is also not a problem. However, this error results in the rda2ft.exe to stop.

          Thus I would like to change line 357 from
          "keepRunning = 0;"
          to
          "keepRunning = 1;"

          I've tried compiling it myself, but after installing vC++ and friends I still don't get matlab to correctly compile the file. As such, I would like to ask for help this way, and possibly contribute to Fieldtrip.

          Included is the mail sent from R. Oostenveld.

          Dear Casper,

          Thank you for filing this bug report. Since this bug manifests in a live environment that includes specific hardware, I think it is best to setup a meeting. I'll send a separate email with details.

          Best regards,

          Boris Reuderink

          @Casper, I have committed a new executable [1]. Could you verify that it indeed works, and tell me if that solves your problem?

          Best,

          Boris
