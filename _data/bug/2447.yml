          Arjen seems to have diagnosed the problems, but failed to report the outcome of the check of the existence of the plotting tutorial.

          test_tutorial plotting does not seem to exist.

          It would make sense to make it

          Hi Nietsche,

          Did you try surfaceplotting with an up-to-date version of FT? There was an issue that has been solved on monday.

          Yours,

          @ Arjan, thanks for the tip. I did a new svn update, and played around with cfg.surfdownsample but I think my matlab session was just not running smoothly anymore so I just started a new session and all was fine. Now I know how to make use of cfg.surfdownsample :)

          @JM/Arjan:

           ft_clusterplot checks the input for cfg.correcttail and cfg.alpha. However, it assumes that the user will always specify these two fields, which may not be the case e.g., user just wants to look at clusters without correcting. To deal with this I added an <if exist> on line 140 - is this okay?

          I have svn committed ft_clusterplot.m and test_tutorial_plotting.m for now.

        thetext: 'Cfg.alpha as an option is a bit unlucky  in this context. Probably we need to implement rather a cfg.highlightprobthreshold (as a vector, just like the other highlightxxxx options). Related to this, we discussed that as such the interpretation in clusters does not make sense to begin with. although we don''t want to disable the function we should build in a warning note in the tutorial about this, and probably make a faq: can I interpret shape and extent of a cluster obtained with a cluster-based permutation statistical approach? Answer: NO. Next, check whether there is sufficient documentation of the correcttail option.'

          The original task of plottin function (items 1-7) was completed and added to svn a while ago.  The change on line 140 (comment 13) was removed.
          However, bug isn't closed because of two new tasks

          1. add a warning in tutorial that we shouldn't interpret the data in terms of clusters.
          2. write an FAQ on why not, and link that to the tutorial

          3. check documentation on correcttail - Done. There is sufficient documentation here: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/why_should_i_use_the_cfg.correcttail_option_when_using_statistics_montecarlo


          Wil get cracking on 1 and 2.
