          diff for patch

          Enhancement code submission; one annoyance I've come across in ft_rejectartifact is that when I get to the end of the trials it takes me one or two clicks of the mouse on the "good>" button before I realize I'm looking at the same trial over and over again. In that vein, I'm submitting this patch. It does two things:

          1) dim the "<", "<<", ">>'', and ">" buttons when appropriate (based on info.trlop and info.ntrl)

          2) dim the "good>" and "bad>" buttons if they were used to set the status of the last trial

          Point 2 is accomplished by recording the last viewed trial and seeing if the last viewed trial is the same as the current one. Most of the changes are incorporating the info.ltrlop (last trial) parameter into the code.

Also, I had a few ideas for improving the rejectsummary as well, including allowing the metric to be changed using radio buttons. If I get that working I'll submit a new bug report with patch."
