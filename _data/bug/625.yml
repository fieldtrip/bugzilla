        thetext: "Hi Johanna\n\nI think that statistics_stats (underlying cfg.method=stats) is so old that it is not worth to try to fix the problem. Mpst, if not all methods are available under cfg.method=analytic). I suggest removing statistics_stats from fieldtrip and the documentation. \n\nIf any, I think it makes more sense to provide the small snippets of code that it contains as example scripts.  \n\nRobert"

        thetext: Yes, I half-suspected statistics_stats was meant to be deprecated.  I did also run a for-loop calling ttest in my own scripts, over the channel and frequency dimension, but leaving the time (largest) dimension, then the output of [h,p,ci]=ttest() are vectors of length time, which in my particular case made it run in 11seconds versus 3hours using FT code! But that is only possible if considering these dimensions separately.

        thetext: "Hi Robert,\nYou asked me to remind you of our conversation in which we said statistics_stats would be deprecated, but the knowledge would get transferred to a new page within http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example#statistics  \nYou said you'd start the wiki page to create an outline and then I will do the work of moving the info from the code to wiki.\n\nWe also discussed vectorisation of the input into each matlab stats function to speed computation rather than for-loops."

          thanks, much appreciated :-)

          I have made a start at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/statistics_toolbox, and will continue (hopefully tomorrow) to fill the page.
