        thetext: Johanna mentioned that she did not get bugzilla mails any more. Let's check whether this one arrives.

          Yes, she got this one, thank you :-)

          However, the daily 'your bugzilla list needs attention' email hasn't come since 11 Dec.   I know everyone was complaining at one point about it and wanted it shut off, so if it has been shut off on purpose, then great!  (I had been using it as my daily check to see if my Donders email was forwarding to my gmail correctly).
