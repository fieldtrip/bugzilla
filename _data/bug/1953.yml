          He's called Holm, the method is usally referred to as Holm-Bonferroni method. So you think it might be better to called it holm rather than holms? (which would then stand for Holm's method)

          In relation to the discussion in the EDA, I just read the wikipedia on
          Holm-Bonferoni. If the entry on HOLM-bonferroni is correct, Jorn got Holm-Bonferroni and Hochberg mixed up. Apparently Holm-Bonferroni can be applied in any case, while Hochberg may only be applied when observations are independent or "under some forms of positive dependence". Which version is implemented in fieldtrip under Holm?

          no, the FWER page says Holm looks for the largest k such that P_k > (...). The FWER page actually makes the point that the Hochberg procedure is different from Holm, cause Hochberg looks for the smallest k such that P_k < (...), but the Holm-bonferroni page states that that is the algorithm that searches for the smallest k such that P_k < (...).

          Pretty confusing.

It is unfortunate that the statement is mirrored in the two explanations. \n\nOn FDR vs FWER (the rate's, not the method of correction, like the following:\nControlling FWER is a form of simultaneous inference, where all inference made in a family are jointly corrected up to a pre-specified error rate. Depending on the definition of the family, the researcher might choose a different form of inference:\nFor example, simultaneous inference may be too conservative for certain large-scale problems that are currently being addressed by science. For such problems, a selective inference approach might be more suitable, since it assumes that any sub-group of hypotheses from the large scale group can be viewed as a family. Selective inference is usually performed by controlling the FDR (false discovery rate criteria). FDR controlling procedures are more powerful (i.e. less conservative) procedures than the familywise error rate (FWER) procedures (such as the Bonferroni correction), at the cost of increasing the likelihood of false positives within the rejected hypothesis.\n\nFrom the wikipedia page on FWER:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familywise_error_rate#Simultaneous_inference_vs._selective_inference"

          Difference between Holm and Hochberg method according to Wikipedias FWER page

          (In reply to comment #11)

          no, I don't think you are right. The simplified example Robert gave is not appropriate, because we are shooting at a moving target here. See the attached figure. If you prove me wrong, I would be happy though.

          So, for me the question remains, which of the two Wiki-pages is correct.

        thetext: So what I think the labels in de the figure are mixed up. Holm-Bonferroni is 6, while Hochberg is 8. Holm-Bonferroni is the more conservative method that is applicable in any case, while for Hochberg you should be able to assume independence (or special cases of positive dependence apperently). This is also how I was thought the Holm method years ago in Groningen.

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #14)\n\nI see. The \"problem\" is in 6 and 8 being below and 7 being above the line, which I had not considered in comment #11. That makes the two descriptions of Holm's procedure inconsistent.\n\nOn identifies R=k=8 as the largest below the line, and rejects H0 for 1:8. The other identifies k=7 as the smallest above the line and rejects H0 for 1:6. \n\nConclusion: we have two description of Holm's procedure that are inconsistent.\n\nHochberg is also described twice. I find the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familywise_error_rate to be least precise as it suggests a step-wise procedure but does not make the steps explicit, whereas the separate page on Holm explains it irrespective of the stepping. \n\n----\n\nI found this explicit comparison \nhttp://www.stat.osu.edu/~jch/PDF/HuangHsuPreprint.pdf\nwhich is consistent with Holm's resulting in 1:6 and Hochberg in 1:8.\n\nIt suggests that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm–Bonferroni_method (which also mentions Hochberg) is correct. \n\nIt also states: \"Holm’s method is based on the Bonferroni inequality and is valid regardless of the joint distribution of the test statistics. Hochberg’s method is more powerful than Holm’s method, but the test statistics need to be independent or have a distribution with multivariate total positivity of order two or a scale mixture thereof for its validity (Sarkar, 1998).\"\n\n\n-----\n\nI guess we now have enough insight to fix the implementation in \"ft_statistics_analytic.m\" around line 94."
