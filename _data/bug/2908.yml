          Note that you have SVN write access to fieldtrip/external/egi_mff, but not to fieldtrip/fileio (which is core functionality). If you make extensions to ft_write_data, please send them to me and I'll review and incorporate them.

          I just looked in external/egi_mff, and noticed that there is already a write_mff_data.m and a write_mff_event.m. I guess your job is to wrap them into ft_write_data and ft_write_event.
