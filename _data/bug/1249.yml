          The issue is that after backprojecting the data to sensor space the number of labels does not match the number of chanpos and chanori anymore. Moreover, all chanpos and chanori are NaN, but I believe that this was intended.

          I guess that the number of chanpos positions are all channels + the number of components removed

          To reproduce: see test_bug1249.m

        thetext: Would it be an idea to just keep the original grad structure after ft_componentanalysis? Obviously, it should *not* be called comp.grad, but something like comp.topograd (analogous to comp.topolabel, which is strictly speaking also not applicable to the data anymore). Let's discuss during the meeting.

          This has been discussed during the bug binge, and the exact outcome of the discussion was not entirely lost. JM will work on this, keeping in mind the recent work to ft_rejectcomponent.

          Suspected cause = keepunused = 'yes' at line 176 of ft_rejectcomponent. It could be that it keeps not only the reference channels, but also the 'components', 'grad-wise'.

        thetext: The cause of this bug has been tracked to an error in ft_apply_montage, where the subselection of chanpos was omitted.
