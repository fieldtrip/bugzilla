        thetext: "I found only one case where it could be meaningfull, badchannel in ft_channelrepair. I could have missed others. \n\nWhat stopped me to put a simple error at the end of ft_channelselection is around line 90. When the desired channelselection is empty, it does a return.\nThere must be a reason why this is here ;). \n\nParking this bug for now. In my view, it is expected behaviour to receive an error when no channels are selected."

        thetext: "After discussion in the FT-meeting on 7-11-2012 it was decided it was undesired behavior for ft_channelselection to produce an error when nothing is selected. \n\nI initially came across this while working on one of the test-scripts that failed (ft_channelrepair doesn't give an error or anything like that). IIRC the reason for failure was unrelated. I will try to remember/find which one failed."
