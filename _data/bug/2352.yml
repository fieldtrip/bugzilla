          Hi

          The documentation of ft_statistics_montecarlo doesn't mention we can set : cfg.statistics = 'diff_itc'

          Also I think it should mention 'diff' and 'mean' but I'm not sure.

        thetext: I agree that documentation can be improved, but then should aim at being more similar to how trialfuns are documented. Perhaps statfun_mean and statfun_diff have to be renamed to statfun_example1 and statfun_example2, and provide pointers to a FAQ or other wiki documentation.

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable.
