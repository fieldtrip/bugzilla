        thetext: "the DCCN server room will be moved, causing at least 24h and possibly more downtime. This involves taking all servers offline (including the VMWare ESX host that serves the website), taking 250TB of NetAPP storage offline, moving all components up and assembling it again.  \n\nSince the website receives about 600 users per day, I would like to move it temporary to another location, e.g. my basement at home. I have 100Mbps fiber at home, so w.r.t. throughput that should work.\n\nWe can use the situation to also migrate the website from the fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl domain to the fieldtriptoolbox.org domain."

          besides the wiki, we have bugzilla, svn and ftp server. I think that we can live without svn and bugzilla. But we might want to migrate them in DNS as well. I think that for ftp it would be nice to have a temporary solution as well (for distributing the software and tutorial data).

          In the future they could look like this

          wiki.fieldtriptoolbox.org
          svn.fieldtriptoolbox.org
          ftp.fieldtriptoolbox.org

          I took the linux server PC home with me, put it in my basement and fired it up. DNS resolution is working fine thanks to duckdns. I configured my linksys so that it has an internal fixed IP address and that all traffic is directed to the linux server PC.

          www.fieldtriptoolbox.com is now working fine :-)

          ftp.fieldtriptoolbox.com is not yet working :-(

          vsftpd was not running, now it is. So ftp also works.

          Rene (CC) will update the DNS recode this Thursday at 9:00 according to
          - fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl will be a CNAME pointing to fieldtrip.duckdns.org
          - bugzilla.fcdonders.nl will be a CNAME pointing to fieldtrip.duckdns.org

          Prior to 9:00 on Thursday I will switch both the old and the new wiki to read-only and synchronise the old to the new. After the switch I will switch the new wiki to read-write.

          I have updated the sitemap.xml.gz to the new domain.

          Google is returning the correct URL. We might look into improving the minidisplay that google offers.
