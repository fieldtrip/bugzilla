        thetext: "Johanna wrote by email:\n\nJust a minor thing, but a girl here with 256 EGI cap is successfully using ICA and the ft_topoplot for the components, with 'GSN-HydroCel-256.sfp' as cfg.layout.  But when she uses ft_databrowser to see the components, the topographies themselves go off the side of the left square of the figure, so you can only see the right half of the sensor layout.   the time courses appear fine.   Any idea for this visualization issue?\n\n-----\n\nTODO to reproduce the bug: create a raw data structure with the channels from  GSN-HydroCel-256.sfp, run componentanalysis with method=pca, visualize in ft_databrowser.\n \nTODO for solving it: ft_databrowser should not make assumptions on the spatial dimensions contained in the layout. They can be -0.5 to 0.5, or pixels, or arbitrary scaled and offset. Probably ft_databrowser should be translating and scaling the layouts such that they match the expected values for the position (e.g. always between 0 and 1)"

          This also occurs with the ctf151 layout with data taken from the tutorial. Assigning to me.
          Johanna, do you maybe know of an example where it works in the current version? Or is it always broken?

        thetext: "Yes, it does now plot the full topos correctly.  \n\nOnly thing now is that it is slow to update: first only the time series appear, taking up the full width of the plot, then seconds later the topos appear, displacing the time-series enough to fit.  If someone doesn't know to be patient, they could think at first that no topos will appear.  I don't recall this happening before, and the mentat I'm on is not busy/full."
