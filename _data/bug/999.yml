          hooray, one thing works, next fails ;)
          In ft_sourceinterpolate, interp_ungridded is called with 'projectmethod' = 'linear' by default (line 116 and line 195), but interp_ungridded does not support 'linear' as a method (as also the help text suggests, it should be 'nearest', 'smudge or 'sphere_avg'. This part is also missing in the FT tutorial. What method to use by default?

          btw, #999, one more!

        thetext: "Hi Jörn, \n\nNo, probably not OK. I think the default should still be linear (as this has been the default for the past 7 or so years). It's interp_ungridded who misbehaves. If the traditional code is used, 'linear' as method is supported. We should either make the default value conditional on the is2Dfun/is2Dana etc, or make interp_ungridded support 'linear' as an interpolation method."
