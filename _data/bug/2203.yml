If I stretch the figure, the font gets bigger. That is nice. If I then do arrow-down (i.e. display next 10 components) a redraw of the labels is done with a small font. Confusing. If I then resize the window to its original format, the labels scale down along with it, making them tiny.\n\nThere is also bug 2065 which is related to this. \n\nI suggest we sit down do define the desired behaviour, and only then try to implement it accordingly."

          This last enhancement to databrowser produces an error when using the on-the-fly cfg.preproc input box more than one time in a databrowser window:

          parent = get(h, 'parent');
          cfg = getappdata(parent, 'cfg');

          % parse cfg.preproc
          if ~isempty(cfg.preproc)
            tmpcfg = cfg.preproc;
            cfg = [];
            cfg.preproc = tmpcfg;
            code = printstruct('cfg', cfg);
          else
            code = '';
          end

          As soon as this happens a new cfg is created. Later in the code cfg.editfontsize and cfg.editfontunits are called, which do not exist anymore at this level:

          set(ppeh, 'FontName', 'Courier', 'FontSize', cfg.editfontsize, 'FontUnits', cfg.editfontunits);

          I have now fixed this by assigning both font options to new variables before the cfg is overwritten:

          editfontsize = cfg.editfontsize;
          editfontunits = cfg.editfontunits;

          set(ppeh, 'FontName', 'Courier', 'FontSize', editfontsize, 'FontUnits', editfontunits);

        thetext: "This is still annoying. \nI'll do something on this soon. \n\nMultiple efforts failed so far. This had partially to do with different matlab versions dealing with font size in different ways, and different use-cases where didn't think well enough and edited back and forth.\n\nI'll have another go at this. I'll use an estimation of appropriate font sizes, with a hard minimum. If names are overlapping, I'll cut some of them out. As such, I've added bug 2348 to this, to enable identify channel in vertical mode (when nchan>100 a necessary feature anyway). \n\nIt will not be ideal in all cases, which is something we'll have to accept (together with the identify function). Now it's broken in a lot of cases, my goals is to get to a higher number of fixed cases. I'll test and post some pictures as well."

        thetext: "Alright, I think I FINALLY have decent solution for this.\n\nRobert/JM/others, could you checkout the following branch and see whether you agree/disagree? (no pull request yet)\nhttps://github.com/roemervandermeij/fieldtrip/tree/bugfix2203\n\n\nHere's what's the default in the above:\n- channel labels are now always plotted as 12 point font\n- cfg.plotlabels = 'some' by default\n- all labels have y-ticks\n- how many labels will be plotted is adaptive w.r.t. to window size\n(this is done using windows size in pixels, which should be robust)\n\nThe result is that when people plot with cfg.viewmode = vertical for the first time, channels labels will (likely) always be non-overlapping and be at readable font size. If the window is big enough, all labels will be plotted.  \n\nAll user options using cfg.plotlabels = 'yes', cfg.fontunits/size, and defaults (like y ticks) are left intact. \n\nWe could implement it as such, but without defaulting to the above. But, I think with this we will capture the largest amount of users possible, making the defaulting reasonable.\n\nLet me know what you think..."
