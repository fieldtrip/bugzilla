        thetext: "This was caused by ft_sourceinterpolate incorrectly 'thinking' that the anatomical volume was a 2D mesh. \nThe reason was that it checks for the .pnt field being present in the mri; this took precedence over checking for a .transform field. Since JM has added .pnt as a field after calling ft_volumerealign (-> this should be fixed!), this led to unexpected behavior in ft_sourceinterpolate.\nThis is fixed in revision 5227."
