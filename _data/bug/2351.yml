        thetext: "as discussed in this Wednesday's meeting: \n---\nThere are 5 different ways of giving information to users about the running of a code:\n\nsilent: It is not communicated what happens\nprint: Notifications are printed on screen. E.g.: “processing trials”\nwarning once: A warning printed on the screen when it occurs first.\nwarning: A warning printed on screen. E.g.: “Warning: no baseline correction”\nerror: Error printed on screen and the process is terminated.\nWe agreed today about the following:\n\nwe should use warning and error identifiers.\nWe would also like to give more information about the warnings. As a general guideline, when a warning is implemented, there should also be a frequently asked question created which explains why the warning has been implemented. The warning identifiers could help the user to find the relevant FAQ. The FAQ should also have a 'warning' tag.\nBy using identifiers, warnings can be switched off automatically in Matlab. Hence, 'warning once' will be not necessary.\n---\n\nThis should be added to http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/guidelines/code e.g. under a subheading \"Provide the appropriate level of feedback to the user\""
