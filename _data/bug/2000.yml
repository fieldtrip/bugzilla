        thetext: There was indeed a whole python re-implementation of Nutmeg, so naturally it should happen with FT as well :-)

        thetext: Actually, the main reason that parts of Nutmeg were converted to python was to enable collaboration with a DTI group that displayed their tracts in python code, so that MEG source-space blobs and DTI tracts could be displayed together in a lovely GUI.   So maybe considering it for displaying of results is not a crazy idea, if python can do it better than Matlab!  (whether it can or whether it depends on the person coding it, I don't know).

          We could hire a bunch of kids that first do the tutorials on this website and then do the work for us. There's also other programming languages we may consider...
