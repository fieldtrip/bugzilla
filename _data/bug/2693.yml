          I installed the arctic template, works fine.

          I also installed the A_Centered_Perspective template, works fine. It is the one that seems to be closest to the FIeldTripV2 design and is also by a developer that goes with the name Anymorphic.

          this should allow you to change them on the command line as eelspa@webserver, and also use the web UI to change them (i.e. apache@webserver).

          It should not stay like this too long...

          This now works: http://fieldtest.fcdonders.nl/start?do=admin&page=searchindex

          I am currently rebuilding the index (takes a long time), this possibly needs to be done again when we go live?

          Also I tried copying these files over, but could not because of permissions:

          downloads.php
          gettweets.php
          tweetcache.txt
          robots.txt
          favicon.ico

          I think that's it. And then there is the folder /tweetmail/, which is also used, namely by a cronjob. The script checks for new posts to the mailing list and, if present, tweets about them. This script does not, I think, necessarily need to be in the webroot. However, it also can't hurt to keep it there (and that might be convenient given that the webserver is guaranteed to have a working PHP installation).

          The indexing through the browser seems to have crashed, not sure why (not a javascript error). Possibly this is due to there being a LOT of files? I tried it using the shell:

          cd /var/www/fieldtest.fcdonders.nl/bin/
          ./indexer.php -c

          but that one requires permissions I don't have (so you could try it with sudo). I hope/assume the shell version of the script will be faster than through the browser.

          except for some rendering problems due to FieldTripV2, it seems to me that everything is working again. Hence I declare the new wiki to be opened. Happy editing!

          @Core team members, please make a report here if you notice something that does now work as expected.

          There seems to be an issue with SVG figures.

          the files are there. I installed the latest version of the plugin and updated conf/mime.local.conf

          There are now 109 figures broken:

          > cd /var/www/fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/data/media
          > find . -name \*.svg | wc -l
          109

          I cannot fix it

          I have fixed the toolbar, at least somewhat, such that the mediabrowser will popup again. Inserting images from there is still problematic.

          However, I noted something very strange, which might be related to some of the issues we've been experiencing. If you load this:

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/lib/exe/js.php

          you'll see a line somewhere near the top:

          /* XXXXXXXXXX begin of lib/scripts/jquery/jquery.js XXXXXXXXXX */

          There is no lib/scripts/jquery/ in the old wiki, only in the new... So for some reason the wiki is loading scripts from the new version. I dug around a bit to see if I could find out what this could be caused by, but could find nothing.

          Now I deliberately broke the toolbar again, namely by re-including jQuery through our own template. We should first figure out why the js.php is outputting JavaScript from a weird folder (or why the wrong js.php is being called). If we fix that, then jQuery will not be loaded anymore, and in that case if the jQuery is not in our template, then the whole wiki will break. So it's better to now do without the toolbar for a little more, fix the js.php issue, then see how to fix the toolbar, then to risk a totally broken wiki through a bugfix.

          Eelke, is there a workaround for uploading figures to the wiki? I see that some issues have to be resolved before the toolbar is working again but if possible we need a way of uploading figures to the wiki.

          I noticed that the media files of the wiki are accessible through 'H:\common\matlab\fieldtrip\data\wiki\media\'

          Is it possible to drop files in, for example, 'H:\common\matlab\fieldtrip\data\wiki\media\tutorial\natmeg' and access these figures from the wiki by using something like: {{tutorial:natmeg:natmeg_erf5.png?700|Figure 5; blabla}}

          I would try it myself but I do not have rights to write to the wiki folder.

          Yes, that should be possible. I see that /media/ and the files in it have a kind of weird permission setting (rwxr-xrwx). Robert, perhaps we could add write permissions for the group to /media/ and the files/folders? (I don't have the rights to do so, obviously.)

          @Stephen: I think the svg issue is also caused by the issue I sketched earlier (wrong script files).
