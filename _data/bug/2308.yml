          Hi guys,

          I was just trying to plot the results of a call to ft_freqstatistics where I used a 'depsamplesF' test. Obviously the F value returned cannot be negative, so I was not surprised to see 'posclusters' and 'posclusterslabelmat' in my data structure, but no 'negclusters' or 'negclusterslabelmat'.

          However, when I then call ft_clusterplot to plot the data, I get the following error...

          >> ft_clusterplot(cfg,stat)
          reading layout from file CTF275.lay
          the call to "ft_prepare_layout" took 0 seconds and required the additional allocation of an estimated 0 MB
          ??? Reference to non-existent field 'negclusterslabelmat'.

          Error in ==> ft_clusterplot at 179
            negCLM = squeeze(stat.negclusterslabelmat);

          Adding a fake - empty - field makes it happy again...

          stat.negclusterslabelmat=[]; % this now plots

          ...but I guess it would be neater if clusterplot were prepared for the output from freqstatistics.

          Best,
          Tom
