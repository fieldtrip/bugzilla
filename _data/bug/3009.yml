          ft_average_sens crashes now in SPM when averaging fiducials which still have a .pnt field (and will probably keep it in the near future). Here it's not sufficient to fix the input but the output should also be converted back to .pnt to make the change transparent. I reverted to previous version of the function in SPM for now.

          This is not so transparent any more then. In any case you should do a fix for the input and I'll do for the output. Currently it crashes inside the function.

          Hi Robert,

          Are you planning to fix this soon? Guillaume wants to release an SPM update soon and we'd like to include the fix in it. For now I reverted to the old version of the function.

          Thanks,

          Vladimir

          OK, I despaired of waiting and fixed it myself. Please check.
