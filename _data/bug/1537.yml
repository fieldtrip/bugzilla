          For istance, I ran something like this:

          memtic;
          ... = ft_preprocessing(...);
          ... = ft_preprocessing(...);
          ... = ft_preprocessing(...);
          memtoc;

          and it gave me an output of some 300 MB. However, when I submitted the exact same code as a job to qsubexec, with a memreq of 1e9 (so quite a margin even!) the job was killed.

          When I substantially increased the memreq to 4e9, the job succeeded, and then indeed the feedback returned was something like "Job XXX returned, it required XXX seconds and 3.4 GB".

          Sorry, of course I meant 'submitted the exact same code as a job to *qsubcellfun*'.

        thetext: "discussed in FT-meeting: it is a consequence of how matlab deals with the memory usage. The memtic/memtoc can either over or under estimate the useage. Only when starting from a totally fresh session, it will actually reflect the true memory requirements.\nSince this appears to be a matlab feature it cannot be really dealt with in the code. \n\nOutcome: rephrasing the statement that is printed regarding memory useage should be adjusted.\n\nByproduct: remove the memory statement for windows."
