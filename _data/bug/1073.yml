        thetext: "Dear FT users, developers, bug reporters and fans,\n\nFor our annual group meeting we will do a grabbelton ('lucky grab'), the idea being to randomily pick questions and practical tips to read out loud and (in case of the former) to answer them together with the group.\n\nWe are still in desparate need of more *tips* though. Everyone has probably some tips and tricks that would be great to share! Once we have enough we could use these on the FT wiki? \n\nSo if you have the time this week, please take a moment to think of one (or more) practical tip(s) concerning MEG/EEG analysis, recording etc., FT analysis, Matlab issues, or even other practical tips concerning research in general, Windows/Linux hotkeys, anything really! It can also be fun! \n\nPlease phrase them in the form of \"Did you know ...  ?\"\n\nThank you!"

          Good idea! Here are some small tips

          - configure MATLAB to use windows keybindings on its Linux version (default is emacs keybindings)

          - start a VNC server on mentat001 or mentat002 and use "ssh -x `martini` matlab2010b" to start matlab on the best mentat node.

          - use qsubcellfun to speed up your analysis by distributing the computational load of subjects and/or conditions and/or different settings on the cluster

          - use cfg.checkconfig='pedantic' in all your fieldtrip functions to ensure that you are using the correct cfg options

          Ooh, fun!

          - when using single/multiplotTFR, use cfg.maskstyle = 'saturation' to avoid openGL artifacts in matlab when saving to *.eps.

          - when still having display issues, do a set(gcf, 'renderer', 'zbuffer') to avoid more matlab bugs

          - when using a statistical mask of 0's and 1' when plotting, transform it to e.g. 0.7's and 1's to get an opacity mask ((mask .* 3) + 0.7). You can also do this when cfg.maskstyle = 'saturation'

          - when zero-padding data for frequency analysis, pad to a power of 2 to greatly speed up computation (cfg.pad = nextpow2(max(cellfun(@numel,data.time))))

          - as a power-user, check for undocumented and unsupported options in the function m-file, just below the normal documentation

Do make sure you don't put the foam in between the back/top of the head and the helmet though, as that will reduce the signal; padding should mainly be to the side of subjects' heads?\n \nTip: It is easy to do a proper calibration of the eyetracker in the MEG lab? Diego has written a nice MATLAB/Psychtoolbox script that presents dots to a subject on various locations on the screen, while at the same time sending out triggers to the Bitsi. Eelke has written a MATLAB/FieldTrip script that parses MEG data files containing these triggers, and performs linear regression to create a function that converts measured eyetracker voltages back to visual degrees. (For simple fixation/blink/movement detection, this conversion is usually not needed, by the way.)\n\nTip: Did you know that subjects can make it better through the experiment if you have them close their eyes during the break? Their eyes do not dry out so much over the experiment. Also this makes them relax their muscles, especially in the neck-area.\n \nTip: Did you know you can use Linux' md5sum to check the integrity of (data) files?\n \nQuestion: How can I best manage references, so what reference manager would you advise (Endnote, Zatero, or something else?)\n \nTip: Did you know that when using Linux you can copy text by selecting it and pasting it by clicking the middle (scroll) button of the mouse?\n \nQuestion: How can I get the zlim scale displayed automatically without having to click on it every time I make a plot?\n \nTip: Did you know that everything you ever wanted to know about signal processing (e.g. how does a FFT work) is explained fantastically in The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing\nby Steven W. Smith, Ph.D., and is free online (www.dspguide.com )?"

          Now this I am curious about, who wrote this tip?:
          *******
          Tip: Did you know that by doing a baseline correction, you miss out on broad
          band gamma effects? So best it is best to make contrasts between 2 conditions
          without baseline correction. Both a prestimulus baseline and the whole trial as
          its own baseline will make the broad band gamma disappear!
          *******

          I do not see why either the non-oscillatory or oscillatory broadband gamma would suffer from a broad DC shift when you baseline your raw data, or when you baseline your frequency transformed data.

        thetext: "I guess with broadband gamma effects is meant 'broadband spectral changes'? \n\nSecondly, there's some truth in there as power-law scaling effects (the exponent x in P ~ A * f^-x; in a way also broaband) may disappear after baseline correction in some frequency bands.\n\nIllustration:\n\nspectrum baseline: - \nspectrum post baseline: \\\n\nwhere, left part is low freq, right part is high freq. Note that when each frequency is normalized by its value during a pretask baseline, this effectively removes the presence of the 1/f^x spectrum. This biases one to where the differences are largest and not to the underlying mechanism (like is done typically in ERPs and well, also frequency-analysis). Therefore, inspecting the absolute spectrum is strongly advised for getting a better feeling. \n\n \n\n(In reply to comment #7)"

          Ah, so we are talking about baselining spectrally resolved data. Even then though, if there are increases in broadband gamma post-stimulus, as in broadband increases in amplitude, it would be observable, also after baselining. That's why it's an increase, and an effect ;). It is not the power-law scaling that defines broadband 'gamma' increases, it is the change in power-law scaling after let's say 80ish Hz, that defines it. Broadband power increases are seen in power spectra by a 'tilting' around such a frequency, with a different X. A nice paper by Kai Miller shows this. (can't remember the year, but you know of I think no Arjen?). After baselining power-spectra, this would still be there. Unless I'm missing something obvious and have a board nailed to my face (which I hope is also an english expression).


          Regardless of that though, I'm always in favor of inspecting the rawest possible data forms ;).

        thetext: "Basically, the amplitude A in the power-law formula (P ~ A * 1/f^x) reflects presynaptic spike firing rate (non-oscillatory effects - see Miller's papers indeed). \n\nThe exponent x is indeed known to be different below (1/f^2) and above (1/f^4) the knee at around 80 Hz. \n\nThe frequency-location of the knee depends on the decay timescale of synaptic influx/efflux processes. These processes namely act as a low-pass filter effectively taking signal energy from 80 Hz and up.\n\nAlso the loss across the dendritic membrane (decay time of say 100ms) has a low-pass characteristic. This process is the last to cause the 1 over f effects.\n\nI just gave a BBM on this topic, too bad you missed it. :)\n\nIn theory, if only A increases, one should see this at all frequencies, even after ft_freqbaseline. Problematic is in practice that both oscillatory and non-oscillatory sources contribute to your LFP, and thus end up in your powerspectrum. Rhythms, when present, typically have a strong influence and modulations in them are evident. After baselinecorrection and within plotting we typically use a 'minmax' style and focus on a relatively short frequencyrange. It may thus be hard to still see the underlying 'broadband shift'.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n(In reply to comment #9)"

        thetext: "Oooh, mighty interesting, too bad I missed it! I'm thinking a lot about this sort of stuff nowadays. \nStill though, I don't see a reason for the tip in question. If we don't see it because you are focusing on small ranges, sure, but that doesn't have anything with baselining. If A increases after post-stimulus, you will see it after baselining. If the specific range is swamped by the usually bigger oscillatory peaks, sure, it would be more difficult to see. Which would be exaggerated more after baselining. But that also holds for the comparing between conditions and basically every other way of inspecting the data. So, still curious :).\n\n\nSorry for derailing this wonderful 'thread' of yours Stephen :). But, still surprised!"
