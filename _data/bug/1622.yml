        thetext: this is appropriate behavior, isn't it? Otherwise it's ambiguous as to from which trial to select the requested samples.

        thetext: "For now, I added a keyvalue-pair (allowoverlap = true) to fetch_data to escape the error for use in ft_databrowser. \n\nThe need for this arose in databrowser, where there are overlapping trials and cfg.continous = 'yes'. When zoomed out enough, the requested data is present in several trials. \n\nIn effect, the samples requested are taken from the last trial where they occur.\nThe only issue I see with allowing overlapping trials in fetch_data is filter-ringing or other preprocessing steps that can affect each sample in a trial differently."

        thetext: "Ah, wrote the comment in the mean-time. \nI saw two options:\n1) knock out overlapping trials when data was handed as input (it should work fine when read in from disk). This creates different behavior for data on disk vs already read-in.\n2) allow it for data that is already read-in.\n\nI have a slight preference for the last as it is cleaner coding, but smudgier data-handling. But since it is only for browsing, that was okay in my opinion. But not a very strong preference (the error was just in the way)."
