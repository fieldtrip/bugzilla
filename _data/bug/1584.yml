          Hi Lilla,
          I found this bug, as I'm testing test_ft_prepare_singleshell and trying to understand the differences of the old and new ways of headmodels.  I'm not sure I understand this bug, or where this cfg.order is used?  I don't see it used in either ft_headmodel_singleshell or the old ft_prepare_singleshell.

        thetext: "hi Johanna,\n\nI do not know what  \"order\" exactly does, but it is used in ft_prepare_vol_sens in line 292.\n\nBut this can be set only when the leadfield is calculated (because the actual algorithm for the singleshell runs during preparation of the leadfield). cfg.order seems to be a  not-documented but already existing cfg option for ft_prepare_leadfield.\nFt_prepare_leadfield is calling prepare_headmodel which is calling ft_prepare_vol_sens.\n\nIf order should be done already at the ft_prepare_headmodel, then it means  (I think) that the vol should contain not only\n.bnd\n.method = 'singleshell'\nbut also: \n.order field\nand then ft_prepare_leadfield should get this info from vol.order and pass it further to prepare_headmodel... etc.\n\nDoes this answer your question?\n\nI can do this change, if it is agreed that this should be done.\n\nLilla"

        thetext: thanks, clear to me now.  Feel free to make the change to the new ft_prepare_headmodel.  (so long as Robert doesn't disagree).
