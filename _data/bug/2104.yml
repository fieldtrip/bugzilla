        thetext: "Created attachment 447\nFirst trial of the preprocessed data\n\nHi all, \n\nI would like to do a source analysis with MEG data (ctf) which was preprocessed with an older fieldtrip version. For this, I need to redefine the trials of the preprocessed data, which I did with the command from the fieldtrip tutorial:\n\ncfg = [];                                           \ncfg.toilim = [-.5 0];                       \ndataPre = ft_redefinetrial(cfg, data_clean);\n\n\n\nHowever, I get following error message: \n\n\nAttempted to access numcoils(1); index out of bounds because\nnumel(numcoils)=0.\n\nError in channelposition (line 98)\n    if all(numcoils==numcoils(1))\n\nError in ft_datatype_sens (line 127)\n        [chanpos, chanori, lab] = channelposition(sens, 'channel', 'all');\n\nError in ft_datatype_raw (line 130)\n      data.grad = ft_datatype_sens(data.grad);\n\nError in ft_checkdata (line 213)\n  data = ft_datatype_raw(data, 'hassampleinfo', hassampleinfo);\n\nError in ft_redefinetrial (line 104)\ndata = ft_checkdata(data, 'datatype', 'raw', 'feedback', cfg.feedback);\n \n\n\nThank you for your help! \n\nBest, \nJulia"

          Hi Julia,

          I just started looking into this - will let you know soon

          okidoki, at least I tracked down the error to the point where your sensor information is going wrong. The channelposition function, wants to undo the balancing, which would somehow make it for you to revert back to ICs. And then it goes wrong, because it cannot find MEG channels anymore (obviously, because the sensor information consists of ICs now instead of MEG coils).
          I'll continue looking into this

          a workaround for you is to to remove the data.grad.balance:
            data.grad = rmfield(data.grad, 'balance');

          this will make the code work. I remember that we had some discussion about this in the past and after consulting some colleagues, I am fairly sure that this was the conclusion. In data.grad.balance there is basically only the mixing matrix stored. Maybe also data.tra should be removed the same way. I will however make sure that this is really the correct way to do, and we will think about throwing an appropriate warning including a solution for how to solve this error.

          I created a faq for this:
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/i_used_ica_on_my_meg_data_from_before_2012_and_now_fieldtrip_crashes_why_is_that

          I am not sure in how much detail I should explain all the changes, imho the sparse information provided now should be enough for most users
