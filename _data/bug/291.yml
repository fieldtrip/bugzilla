          Created attachment 13
          topoplot selected using interactive, half electrodes missing

          The option interactive is very powerful to investigate effects of interest.

          When I plot:

          cfg = [];
          cfg.interactive = 'yes';
          cfg.layout = lay;
          ft_multiplotTFR(cfg, data);

          it correctly plots all the electrodes on the scalp.

          I can then select a subset of electrodes (f.e. left hemisphere) and it correctly plots the ft_singleplotTFR for the average of those electrodes. If I select an area of interest in the singleplot, it calls topoplot.

          However, topoplot does not plot all the electrodes, but only those that were interactively selected (see attachment, only electrodes in left hemisphere). If you select one or two electrodes, it throws an error.

          Let me know if you need more information.

          Thanks,

          Gio

        thetext: "Hey Giovanni,\n\nDid this occur in a version you downloaded after yesterday? (or in the dev-version). If so, it is probably a side-effect of me adding a cfg.channel option in the multiplotXXX/topoplotXXX functions. The cfg.interactive option also had several other bugs though, I'll have a thorough through all of the code. \n\nFor now, you can easily make a workaround by commenting the calls to ft_selectdata out, it's one line per plot-function and should be somewhere in the beginning and must have an option in it like 'selchan' or so (there must be other calls to checkdata in there as well). If that causes other problems, you also need to comment out the defaulting of cfg.channel.\n\nBest,\nRoemer"

          Hi Roemer,

          It happened indeed only in the latest version.

          Commenting ft_selectdata out did the trick for me.

          I really like the plotting functions and especially the interactive option, fast and easy to use.

          Keep up the good work,

          Gio
