          The bug refers to a recent mail from Margit reporting the look and feel of lead fields genearted with the single sphere model rather than with OM and noticing that they have opposite sign.
          I tested this and replicated the bug (see /forward/test/test#this bug)

          I'm in touch with Alexandre to solve the issue.
