          I am reading in Pascal's old NIH data and according to read_plexon_nex sometimes the first ts of the LFP data lies about 100 ms after the onset of the recording according to read_plexon_nex. This is when the error arises.

          Could you give the precise code (i.e. call to ft_read_data with all arguments) that gives this error?

          Where it goes wrong is for example if begsample = 4, endsample = 100 and offset = 5.
          In this case, we read 95 samples and pad with 5 nans. But the initiated dat would have endsample-begsample+1 = 97 datapoints, which gives a size discrepancy with the initiated vector.

          So we need something like:

          d = (endsample-begsample+1) - (chanendsmp)

          nex.dat = [nan(1,d) nex.dat];

The sample specification in cfg.trl is derived from ft_read_event and passed on to ft_read_data.

          Hi Guys,

          I was on reporting a new bug, but I found it is very related to this one.

          I had some problems with reading some nex data and I noticed the 'header' becomes negative because of integer limits and sign flip at the boundary. I solved it by changing one if-statement (below). I was wondering if I have not changed anything important. Do you have any clue?

          In ~line 986 of ft_read_data, there is the following if:

           if chanbegsmp<1

          which should be changed to :
           if (chanbegsmp<1 && chanendsmp>1) || (chanbegsmp>chanendsmp)

          Agree?

          Created attachment 810
          nex documentation

          (In reply to Teresa Madsen from comment #12)


          On the outside of ft_read_data all fieldtrip code requires samples to be indexed in a continuous manner starting from sample 1 onwards. This applies to regularly segmented data (as in Subject01.ds) where there are unknown holes between otherwise-constant-length segments, but also to situations where segments are of different lengths. If needed, segment boundaries are to be represented in the output of ft_read_event.

          Some file formats (notably neuralynx and neuromag fiff) internally represent samples as "incoming from the system" and allow for acquisition to disk to be separate from that. E.g. those allow internally that the first sample is indexed with a number >1 (depending how long ago the amplifier was started).

          I suspect that something related to this goes wrong. I don't remember having dealt with multi-segment nex files myself. Let me attach the documentation that I have on nex.
