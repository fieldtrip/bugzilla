        thetext: Not sure whether this is the intention, but ft_conjunctionanalysis count it to be there. So in case this is intended behavior (absence of posclusterslabelmat), a simply if isfield in ft_conjunctionanalysis will solve the problem.

        thetext: This might be related to an issue reported in bug2308 (fixed by Eelke). Check what he did to fix this (I think in ft_clusterplot revision 8589). Something like this will probably also be applicable in ft_conjunctionanalysis

        thetext: Removed the obsolete support for pos- and negclusters, which cannot be meaningfully combined between different input arguments. I have also used the occasion to make ft_conjunctionanalysis more robust, i.e. explicitly checking whether the required fields are present in all input arguments.
