          Hi Elli,

          Thanks, I hadn't noticed your patch. As a matter of fact, I think I fixed the issue along the way. The idea is that the subfunctions don't need the timing info. By accident, the stuff related to the timing was copied into the wrong line. It should have been (now changed) copied before the start of any subfunction
