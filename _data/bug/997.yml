        thetext: I checked with my MRIs as well as with the tutorial MRI (Subject01.ds). With the help of JM, we commented the projecttri statement out again. Cristiano, could you look into this? I am not sure what you were trying to achieve there. At least, the segmentation is looking good again for me (i.e. the example data we have)

          Hi Joern
          can you try again by running /test/test_bug937.m with the subject01 MRI?
          It should work fine now

          Cheers
          Cristiano

        thetext: seems fine on my data, haven't tested the test-function though, but I guess it's alrighty
