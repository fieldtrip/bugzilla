          Created attachment 200
          Sample data file that triggers repeated warnings.

          Data files from prototype KIT system (file attached) triggers warning on line 271 of fileio/private/ft_senstype.m repeatedly (>100 times) every time a new file is read.  No problems in reading files.

          I changed two lines in ft_senstype.m from "warning('could be Yokogawa system')"
          to "warning_once". This should lead to a single warning. Get updated FieldTrip
          and try it. I will download your file and test it myself.

          Yours, Till
