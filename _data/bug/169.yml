        thetext: peerexec calls setcustompath but for class objects the class definition (which should be in the path) is not available during function execution. This means that object methods cannot be called. This problem does not occur when a breakpoint is set in the function thus adding an artificial pause during which presumably the class definition does become available. It also does not occur when the peerslave already has the correct path at its disposal.
