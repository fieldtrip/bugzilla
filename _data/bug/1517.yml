        thetext: "Hi Joe,\n\nThis error surprises me a bit, since the ft_dipolefitting calls inverse/dipole_fit, which explicitly checks for the optimization toolbox. If that is not present it will use the slower fminunc function and if it is present it will use the faster fminsearch. \n\nCould you check  what is happening on line 72 in dipole_fit.m? You might want to explicitly clear ft_hastoolbox prior to that. Or just try\n\nclear ft_hastoolbox; \nft_hastoolbox('optim')\n\nIn my case it returns 1. \n\nFrom there you could dig further into the code at line 190 in ft_hastoolbox. That is where the presence of the toolbox AND the availability of a license is checked. The idea is that if the toolbox is installed but a license not available (e.g. because they ran out on the server due to other people using them), that dipole fitting still works.\n\nA more elaborate trail of the error (i.e. the backtrace of where the error happened) might also help. And the output of the \"ver\" command.\n\nRegarding your last comment: do you know how one can \"disable\" toolboxes? The only method I can think of is to reinstall MATLAB from DVD and in the GUI installation procedure make sure that the toolbox is not selected. The license of course will remain available on our university license server, but not having the toolbox in the local installation might be enough to emulate the toolbox-not-available situation."

          Hmmm... not used to this interface...

          Ah, the license error was a red herring that threw off my troubleshooting.  It'd be a good idea to disable the output to the screen with an evalc function call I think.  Anyway, the true problem is:

          Error: File: fminsearch.m Line: 1 Column: 1
          The input character is not valid in MATLAB statements or expressions.

          It occurs at the call:

          [param, fval, exitflag, output] = optimfun(@dipfit_error, param, options, dat, sens, vol, constr, metric, checkinside, reducerank, normalize, normalizeparam, weight);

          I'm not really clear how the @ calls work so I'm having some trouble diagnosing this on my own.  After doing:

          K>> which('fminsearch')
          /Applications/MATLAB_R2012a.app/toolbox/matlab/optimfun/fminsearch.m

          it looks to me like the set of input variables just doesn't match up with what fmnisearch is expecting.
          I'm attaching the contents of my workspace so you can try to replicate this issue.

          Thanks!

          Agh...

          I figured it out.  It's a compatibility conflict with eeglab11_0_0_0b.
          Arno is including Octave versions of some of the Matlab functions it seems.
          When I remove eeglab11_0_0_0b/functions/octavefunc from the path, everything works fine again.
          Matlab isn't giving me the usual warnings of function name conflicts for some reason.
          I guess I need to talk to Arno about this.  I wish he'd be more careful about these naming conflicts.

          Thanks for the help!
