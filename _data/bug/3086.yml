          weird pipeline results

          See the attached figure, which should be the same as the one here http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/eventrelatedstatistics. The same results are obtained for the clusterpermutationtimelock tutorial.

          The error is not in the plotting code itself, since I get the same strange pipeline results when I export to HTML (cfg.filename = 'pipeline.html').

          Two possibilities:
          - ft_analysispipeline is estimating the pipeline wrongly from the cfg.previous... graph;
          - or the provenance is not being kept correctly in the pipeline itself. (Could this be ft_anonimizedata's fault?)

          I'm removing the ft_analysispipeline snippet from the tutorial for now, since we don't want to confuse people...

        thetext: "Looking at the graphical pipeline, it seems that all ft_anonimizedata match the first input. It would make sense that each subject would have its own preprocessing etc. \n\nSo I concur with the suggestion that provenance was messed up. \n\n... Or the actual data was messed up. Are the ERFs actually different over subjects?"

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
