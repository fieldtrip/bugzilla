        thetext: even if speed-up can't be found, at least to avoid confusion to the user, can you set it so that the time-series appear in their final position from the start (rather than displacing/squeezing, once the topos appear)?

          That can be easily achieved by removing the 'drawnow' call, which I assume was only there for development purposes. (removed it now).

          I also found the main reason for the delay. In plot_topo, there is a bit of code to prevent the mask from being recomputed, but that bit fails because the position changes. I'll make it into a new bug. Oh no, so many bugs! :)

        thetext: "I improved ft_plot_topo a little, the calls inside the databrowser are now much fast (mask-previosness-detection slightly improved). However, it was still slow, most of the time is being consumed by interpolating the data. I lowered the requested gridscale/resolution that the databrowser uses a bit, it's much faster now. \nThe change in resolution is barely detectable on my 24\" monitor, so it should be fine?"
