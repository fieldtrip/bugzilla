        thetext: As you might or might not know, once you start typing in the wiki search box, search results will be returned automatically if you wait some time. This time needs to be shorter, and feedback should be provided that this auto-search is going on. Also, the results list needs to be bigger and better; the font is now tiny and the colors are ugly.

        thetext: I think it is already much better now. Not super awesome, but there are some limitations in dokuwiki's architecture that it is difficult to get around (and getting around them would likely break compatibility of our template with future versions).
