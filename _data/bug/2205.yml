          FYI

          the hidden documentation sections with
          % This function depends on XXX which has the following options
          were added quite some time back by Ingrid and Saskia in an effort to increase the coverage of the main reference documentation. Since then, they have not been carefully maintained, so probably it is better to remove them (and/or recreate them where needed).

          Note to self: here is a piece of test code that I had started on.

          -----

          nchan = 20;
          ntime = 40;

          pos = randn(nchan,3);
          pos = 10*bsxfun(@rdivide, pos, sqrt(sum(pos.^2,2)));
          lab = arrayfun(@num2str, 1:nchan, 'UniformOutput', false);

          timelock = [];
          timelock.avg = randn(nchan,ntime);
          timelock.time = 1:ntime;
          timelock.label = lab;
          timelock.dimord = 'chan_time';

          cfg = [];
          cfg.vol.c = 1;
          cfg.vol.r = 10;
          cfg.vol.o = [0 0 0];
          cfg.vol.units = 'cm';
          cfg.elec.elecpos = pos;
          cfg.elec.label   = lab;

          % use default options
          dip1 = ft_dipolefitting(cfg, timelock);

          cfg.grid.xgrid = -10:1:10;
          cfg.grid.ygrid = -10:1:10;
          cfg.grid.zgrid = -10:1:10;
          dip2 = ft_dipolefitting(cfg, timelock);
