          Created attachment 457
          layoutplot of subselected channels

          I got data from before and after an annual service, so different channels across participants. Before, I was always correcting the channelorder manually, but for some final, additional analysis I thought 'let's rely on FieldTrip'... smart idea :)

          I got 20 subjects, compute TFR and then call ft_freqgrandaverage. That function seems to correct for the different channel order, but the plotting still look weird. I selected a subset of parieto-occipital channel and wondered why my topoplot shows channels all over the place. Turns out, something is going wrong with estimating the channel position, see attachement. I can provide data and code if needed

        thetext: it's probably all related to the scaling of the outline, just wonder why. I think this didn't happen before
