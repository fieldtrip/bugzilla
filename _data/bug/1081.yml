        thetext: "Created attachment 179\ncode and sample data at 1000hz(diegoxxx.asc) and 2000hz(litcal.asc)\n\nSpecific problem reading eyelink data sampled at 2000hz but not with data sampled at 1000hz. At 2000hz, eyelink seems to save new information in x, y and pupil channels in to consecutive SAME samples. See the following piece of data:\n\nSamples   x chan   y chan pupil chan  \n\n5198103\t  469.7\t   56.2\t 1955.0\t...\n\n5198103\t  470.4\t   56.8\t 1957.0\t...\n\n5198104\t  470.6\t   56.3\t 1956.0\t...\n\n5198104\t  470.6\t   56.2\t 1954.0\t...\n\n5198105\t  470.5\t   55.3\t 1951.0\t...\n\n5198105\t  470.4\t   54.0\t 1950.0\t...\n\n5198106\t  470.3\t   52.8\t 1951.0\t...\n\n5198106\t  470.4\t   52.6\t 1952.0\t...\n\n5198107\t  470.4\t   52.3\t 1952.0\t...\n\n5198107\t  470.4\t   51.9\t 1950.0\t...\n\nImportantly, I only record one eye, so one can discard the possibility that eyelink was recording at the same sample both eyes (might be with 2000hz eyelink assumes this last option I wasn't able to figure out). With data sampled at 1000hz this problem disapears because each sample has an unique x, y and pupil output.\n\nThe problem come reading the data with ft_read_header:\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\ncfg                     = [];\ncfg.trialfun            = 'eyelink_trialfun2';\ncfg.dataset             = '/home/electromag/dieloz/Desktop/eyetrackerpilot/litcal.asc';\n%cfg.headerformat        = 'eyelink_asc';\ncfg.trialdef.prestim    = 1;\ncfg.trialdef.poststim   = 3;\ncfg.trialdef.events     = [111:119];\ncfg                     = ft_definetrial(cfg);\n\nevaluating trialfunction 'eyelink_trialfun2'\nWarning: creating fake channel names \n>> In fileio/private/warning_once at 81\n  In ft_read_header at 507\n  In eyelink_trialfun2 at 4\n  In ft_definetrial at 161\nfound 80 events\ncreated 9 trials\nthe call to \"ft_definetrial\" took 29 seconds and an estimated 11 MB\n\n>>cfg.trl\n\nans =\n\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n  -Inf   Inf  -Inf\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nInside eyelink_trialfun2.m (an adaptation of Stephen function) I call ft_read_header.m like this: \nhdr=ft_read_header(cfg.dataset,'headerformat','eyelink_asc','dataformat','eyelink_asc','eventformat','eyelink_asc');\n\nand there's a problem reading the sampling rate (line 503):\nhdr.Fs                  = 1000/median(diff(asc.dat(1,:)));\n\nAs diff is used and the samples are twice the same, the output is zero. I tried to solve it doing the following crappy solution\nhdr.Fs                  = 1000/median(diff(asc.dat(1,1:2;end)));\nbut then I get problems with begin and endsamples definition and I get lost.\n\nAlthough this data come from a short pilot and I can now change my new recording to 1000hz, could be a problem reading the 2 eyes.\n\nBest\n\nDiego"
