          Also, explicitly assuming that trl(:,3) exists (at the line where you added a 'bullshit' commentary) is dangerous; when the trl is reconstructed from the sampleinfo this does not work.

          Back to the drawing board it is.

          hm, cannot reproduce your problem with the time-axis, works fine for me. I fixed some things which might have caused this, but I am not really sure... could you check and if it still does not work share a bit of data?

          I fixed the problem trl(:, 3) such that if not already existent, I estimate the offset by the time-axis:
          t0         = interp1(data.time{tr}, 1:numel(data.time{tr}), 0, 'linear', 'extrap');

          and I removed the 'bullshit' comment, meant to do no harm there ;)

          and I fixed a bug that made jumping to a specific trial impossible, cause it always jumped to trial 1
