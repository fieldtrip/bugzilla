          I took this on me. I have reorganized the directory a bit and wrote some scripts to facilitate quick updates.

          Note: the following data formats gave problems and are not yet updated:

          lfp: tdt and neuralynx
          meg; ctf64 and bti148


          @bti148 this is caused by the absence of a 'config' file in the directory: suggestion to make the data reading more robust by reverting to old style .m4d/.xyz reading if config is absent

          bti148 now works: specify filename to be ....m4d
          ctf64 now works: specify dataformat to be ctf_old, and fixed ctf2grad
