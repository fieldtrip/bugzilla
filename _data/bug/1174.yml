          patch to remove 4th output argument to fileparts() in ft_qualitycheck.m

          Starting with Matlab R2010a, the fourth output argument of fileparts() is no longer supported and has been removed. Calling the function with more than three output arguments has been generating a warning since that version R2010a:
          	http://www.mathworks.fr/help/techdoc/rn/br_bpq8-1.html#bsdnyvb-1
          	http://www.mathworks.fr/help/techdoc/ref/fileparts.html

          Although this is not clearly documented and starting with Matlab R2011b, calling the function with more than three output arguments does error.

          I've found a single occurrences of fileparts() being called with 4 arguments in ft_qualitycheck.m:
                [pathstr,name,extr,versn] = fileparts(exportname);
          Can you please fix it? Removing the spurious 4th argument should be enough since neither the 3rd not the 4th argument are used.

          There are actually a few other occurrences in subdirectories external/spm2 and external/spm8 but :
          - SPM8 will be fixed soon: the FIL maintainer is aware of the problem, has fixed it and a patch should be released before next January,
          - SPM2 is not maintained by the FIL anymore but I am in the process of fixing it here:

          Other instances can be found with:
          $ find . -name "*.m" | xargs egrep "\[([^,]*,){2,}[^,]*].*=.*fileparts"

          Files in SVN revision 4870 that use FILEPARTS with four return arguments are:

          ./external/spm2/spm_normalise.m
          ./external/spm2/spm_segment.m
          ./external/spm2/spm_write_sn.m
          ./external/spm8/@nifti/private/read_hdr.m
          ./external/spm8/@nifti/privateread_hdr.m
          ./external/spm8/spm_normalise.m
          ./external/spm8/spm_fileparts.m
          ./external/spm8/spm_vol.m
          ./external/spm8/spm_smooth.m
          ./external/spm8/spm_orthviews.m
          ./external/spm8/spm_write_sn.m
          ./ft_qualitycheck.m

          So it appears that we only have to fix ft_qualitycheck.
