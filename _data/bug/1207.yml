          the _ntt readout function has dimord 'leads_time_spike'
          but the _nse readout function has dimord 'time_spike'
          I would suggest this should by [1 x time x spike] then, so that it's always three-dimensional.
          A waveformdimord field should also be added to the readout functions

          Changed status to assigned, since Martin seems to handle this problem.

          @Martin, what is the current status? Has the issue been resolved?
