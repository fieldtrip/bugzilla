          ft_artifact_shiftdetect

          Hi,

          I've written this function ft_artifact_shiftdetect in 2010 by copying a then up to date ft_artifact_xxx and remodeling it to the current version of this function.

          It's programmed in FTstyle, however, FTstyle 2010. After getting it into FT style 2012 it can be added to FT. Hope it's useful for other as well. I really like it for detecting saccades/eyeblinks in EOG. Might work beautifully for jumps as well. Never tried it for jumps though.

          Cheers,
          Ingrid

        thetext: I suggest to rename it to e.g. ft_artifact_saccade to make the purpose more clear.

        thetext: Fine with me. I just called it shift detect, because I thought, it maybe can be used to detect jumps as well in normal EEG channels.
