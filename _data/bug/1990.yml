          Possibly related to bug1959 - http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=1959 were an enhancement was added to use grad.balance in ft_sensetype to determine sens.type.

          I've added Diego to the CC as he committed the enhancement (rev. 7480)

        thetext: At the meeting, we discussed this, and thought it might also be related to bug 1977, as the test scripts concerned topo plotting, and that's what this bug was about. We could not look at the error message (involving 'balance') at the time though; with that info in mind possibly 1977 is not related after all.

          (In reply to comment #2)
          I didn't ask for the field balance in grad structure: I assumed that was always present but it's not the case. Could someone confirm to me that the balance is only created after using ft_denoise_synthetic,ft_denoise_pca, ft_componentanalysis, ft_megplanar,ft_apply_montage?


          I run all test scripts that failed because my wrong fix and now all they worked fine:
          test_headmodel_singleshell_new_old
          test_bug1043
          test_bug1212
          test_bug131
          test_leadfield_units
          test_ft_read_header
          test_bug1042
          test_bug1043
          test_bug131

          better call it convert_montage. It should be able to do for example

          comp_planar_GBR3_none -> planar_GBR3_none
          comp_planar_GBR3_none -> GBR3_none
          comp_planar_GBR3_none -> none
