          The current working dir from which the call is made, that is. The qsub command executes properly when the working dir is wrapped in "", but then I get e-mails from torque stating that it could not copy the output to the folder (which contains () in its name).

          Originally reported by Til Ole Bergmann. I am investigating.

        thetext: 'This is most likely unfixable: parentheses are meaningful to the Linux shell. They should of course not be allowed in folder names, but unfortunately, they are. So torque will always run into trouble trying to copy output files to a folder having parentheses in its name, unless we tweak the torque source code itself. That seems unlikely to happen.'
