          Added two test files and a bug script in /contrib/spike/test

          Also I have changed the waveform dimensionality everywhere in ft_read_spike

          Robert/Thilo: Could you please check the current lines for the waveform in ft_read_spike for the plexon files since I don't have plexon files here.
