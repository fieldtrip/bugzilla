          Hi all,

          I am analyzing EEG data with FieldTrip and I have compared the grandaverage ERP waves in FT to waves I got with Brain Vision Analyzer. I got different scales (or units). The units of the BVA are in microV. I am wondering what is the unit of the ERP in FieldTrip (if not microV). And it would be nice to document this. (I could not find anything about this in the tutorial).

          Lilla

          the units after timelockanalysis should be identical as the units in which the data was read (ft_read_data or ft_preprocessing). For BVA I had expected that to be uV.

          There is ongoing work to get the units represented in the data. The ft_read_header already returns hdr.units (and hdr.chantype) but for most data those are still unknown.

          Can you save the ERP from BVA in a file, and can that be read in fieldtrip? If so, then you could specify the uV value according to BVA (by looking in the BVA figures) and we can check in FT that we get the same value.

          So if possible, please make an ERP in BVA and write that to file for testing.

          Maybe the problem is than that I use a script that Marcel wrote for reading in BVA data. I will try to read it in also with the appropriate functions.

          I tried ft_read_header but cfg.chanunit says: "unknown".

          You can find the data exported from BVA in /home/language/lilmag/bug1403_erpunit.

          I read the data in:

          cfg=[];
          cfg.headerfile = 'PP1_SEM_MATCH_Average_AUT2.hdr';

          data = ft_preprocessing(cfg,data);


          Then, plotted:

          cfg=[];
          cfg.baseline = [-0.2 0];
          cfg.layout = '61chan_MPI.lay';
          cfg.interactive = 'yes';
          ft_multiplotER(cfg, data);


          The range of the y-axis on the BVA image is between - 50 and 50 uV, while the y-axis in FieldTrip is around min. -35.

          thanks for help!

          I have added fieldtrip/test/test_bug1403, which contains the following

          cd /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/bug1403

          cfg=[];
          cfg.dataset = 'LauraPP1_SEM_MATCH_Average_AUT2.vhdr';
          data = ft_preprocessing(cfg);

          cfg=[];
          cfg.layout = '61chan_MPI.lay';
          cfg.interactive = 'yes';
          figure
          ft_multiplotER(cfg, data);

          figure
          plot(data.time{1}, data.trial{1})
          legend(data.label)

          It produces a figure with positive deflections at 450ms with a max positive amplitude of 35. I presume this is uV. Can you show a BVA figure?

          the length of the vertical bar is 50 uV in total.

          If you draw in the ppt a zero line, and have one of these bars stick out to the top and one to the bottom you get a better idea of the peak amplitude. See attached.

          To me it seems all ok.

          ok, I am sorry then! I understood the BVA y-axis that it runs from -50 to 50 but I should understand then that it runs from -25 to 25. Thanks for the help!
