I would appreciate your input:\n\n1) cfg.mriunits is deprecated. If needed, it is estimated from the input mri\n2) cfg.sourceunits is renamed into cfg.units + default behavior is slightly changed:\n\n  if not specified, it defaults to 'auto', in which case it will use the units in the sensor-structure (at least: if the sensor structure is present). Otherwise, it defaults to 'cm' (which is old behavior)\n  \n3) the output grid will now contain a unit-field (if possible)"
