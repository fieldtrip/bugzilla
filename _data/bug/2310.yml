        thetext: "right now data.cfg.callinfo contains the time and date that the analysis was performed. \n\nFor the HCP it is agreed that we should not reveal too precisely when the subject was scanned.  \n\nIf the data analyses are in general performed shortly after the data acquisition, the analysis date reveals approximately the scan date. Although right now the analysis is done in batches rather than immediately following data acquisition, it is safer not to include the date."
