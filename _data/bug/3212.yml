          we are using fieldtrip20161014 in the Marseille workshop.

          It seems as if the computations go through correctly, but for some reason the intermediately reshaped data (linear representation of all vox-by-vox crsspctrm) is not converted back.

          I am continuing the discussion in this bug, some stuff has been posted erroneously in bug 3211.

          I can confirm the issue, and it seems to occur in the situation where there are fewer dipole locations than observations, causing the function to end up in a different corner of the code, somehow preventing correct dimensionality handling.
