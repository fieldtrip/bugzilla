        thetext: "It seems that you recently start using Matlab R2014b and ask for possible remaining bugs due to the new graphics. I just noticed one using the ft_artifact_zvalue when the cfg.artfctdef.zvalue.interactive is turn on ('yes'). Indeed, when I want to use the command buttons (such as go through the next trial or the next artifact) inside the GUI, I have the following error:\n\nNo appropriate method, property, or field Key for class matlab.ui.eventdata.ActionData.\n\nError in ft_artifact_zvalue>parseKeyboardEvent (line 1074)\nkey = eventdata.Key;\n\nError in ft_artifact_zvalue>keyboard_cb (line 675)\n  key = parseKeyboardEvent(eventdata);\n \nError using waitfor\nError while evaluating UIControl Callback\n\nI don't have any other problems with the other GUIs. I hope it will help you to find the source of the bug."

          thanks for reporting this. I can reproduce the problem in 2014b with

          cfg = [];
          cfg.dataset = 'Subject01.ds'
          cfg.trialdef.eventtype = 'trial'
          cfg = ft_definetrial(cfg);

          ft_artifact_zvalue(cfg)
          cfg.artfctdef.zvalue.channel = 'MEG'
          cfg.artfctdef.zvalue.cutoff = 3
          cfg.artfctdef.zvalue.interactive = 'yes'
          cfg = ft_artifact_zvalue(cfg)

          and then click on the "next artefact" button.

          We will look into this.

          This solves it for interactions with the mouse in the figure.

          For now the reported issue has been resolved. But I could not figure out how the keyboard would have to be used, neither in 2012b nor in 2014b. Hence I will leave this bug open so that this can be addressed at a later point in time.

          Indeed, it works now. Thanks for solving the problem so quickly.
