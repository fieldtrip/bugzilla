        thetext: what structure did you put into ft_sourceanalysis? When I compute a freq-structure with cfg.output = 'powandcsd' I get a freq.label and a freq.labelcmb field, if I use cfg.output='fourier' I only get a .label field. Both worked fine for me. So I wonder what magic you are doing with FieldTrip that I don't know, yet :)

          it's not about how the numeric data are represented, it's about the dimord. There was an explicit check w.r.t it, e.g.

          if strcmp(freq.dimord, 'chan_freq')
          elseif strcmp( etcetc

          'chancmb_freq' was not one of them.

        thetext: it's all about history. chan_chan would actually be the more natural way to format the input. It all boils down to update prepare_freq_matrices with my own local copy (which performs exactly the same, but which is based on a sequence of ft_selectdata calls). Now I speak of it, I am not sure whether the chan_chan is explicitly supported, but the expected behavior would be to just do some bookkeeping on the data and leave it at that.

        thetext: sorry for being a bit cryptic. the output of the function prepare_freq_matrices is a square cross-spectral density matrix (plus some additional stuff if one wants to do 'classical' dics), which has a dimord of chan_chan. If the input contains a chan_chan_freq_time matrix, the only thing that needs to be done is the selection of the frequency and time of interest (if there's anything to choose) and the selection of channels that are not present in the list of required channels (e.g. remove EOG channels if present)

          hm, after some thorough thinking I decided to keep the current version if the freq-structure has crsspctrm and powscptrm and take your version if the freq-structure just has crsspctrm but no powspctrm. Additionally, there is a third case for fourierspctrm. this is definitely the safest option for now, but I'm super confused why this distinction needs to be made in the first place...
