          and quite possibly others.

          Would the following work for the 'ifmakessense' option?:

          - See if trl-matrix present somewhere in the cfg-tree;
          - If not: don't add sampleinfo
          - If yes: check cfg-tree if ft_resampledata has been called
              - If no: copy from trl
              - If yes: don't add sampleinfo

          The hassampleinfo:'yes' option would remain the same as currently with hastrialdef: if no trl-matrix present, attempt to recreate the sampleinfo by assuming the trials are segments of a continuous recording.

          We actually want to get rid of looking into the cfg-tree.

          this was once included for backward  compatibility, but at some point we need to take the decision to not look into the cfg anymore.

Do either of you? Else we could just keep the option at levels yes/no."

        thetext: setting to Fixed for now; if needed I'll reopen it to enable the 'ifmakessense' level.
