          When dealing with 306-channel Neuromag system, we have to separately perform visual rejection for magnetometers and gradiometers. To correctly do so, I want to use cfg.keepchannel = 'yes' in order to separately identify bad magnetometers and bad gradiometers. Then I whish to be able to put all these bas channels together and remove them at once from the data.

          Nevertheless, I did not manage to find the information about the bad channels I selected in the output structure of the ft_rejectvisual function. Is there any way to have this information?

          Best.

          N.B. I also use cfg.keeptrial = 'yes' and manage to get bad trials indices without removing them thanks to the sample information in results.cfg.artfctdef.summary.artifact. Thanks to that information I was able to remove them at once contrary to the channels.

        thetext: "Hi Maxime,\n\nThere is an example foe neuromag on http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/natmeg/timefrequency.  \n\nBut http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/visual_artifact_rejection explains it better (at 2/3 on the page there is a box which specifically deals with this).\n\nWith cfg.keepchannel=yes, the output data.cfg still will contain the channels that were selected (i.e. not deselected). Using union, intersect and the likes you can also make your own version."

          cleaning time.

          I don't think that any code is needed. Better documentation would be useful, but I won't be writing that any time soon.
