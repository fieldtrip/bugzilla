          Option for cfg.inputfile still needs to be implemented.
          Probably similar to ft_headmodelplot, but here one of the options the input can be empty.

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
