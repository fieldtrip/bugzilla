          I have to recompile the buffer mex file on the KLondon CTF MEG system and run into the following

          Compiling helper functions in buffer_mxutils.c ...
          buffer_mxutils.c: In function `matrix_from_ft_type_data':
          buffer_mxutils.c:100: `mwSize' undeclared (first use in this function)
          buffer_mxutils.c:100: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
          buffer_mxutils.c:100: for each function it appears in.)
          buffer_mxutils.c:100: syntax error before "dim"
          buffer_mxutils.c:103: `dim' undeclared (first use in this function)

          Looking at the line 100, it appears that it is a simple typecast that apparently does not (yet) exist in matlab71. Replacing mwSize with int fixes the problem (is not yet in the main branch).

        thetext: 'I added an #ifndef clause to mx_utils.h to define "mwSize" as "int" for compatibility with very old Matlab versions. Just always using an "int" instead might be a bit idea for recent 64-bit platforms with large array support etc.'

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
