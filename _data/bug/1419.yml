          ft_senstype cannot detect the labels as MEG channels, thus it is assumed that the channels do not need an orientation matrix (this is what ft_datatype_sens is doing).

          what kind of data is that anyways? if it is not supported by FT, why do we have that as test data?

        thetext: it is supported by fieldtrip, but not with the default reading functions based on automatic filetype detection. If you specify the format as ctf_old I think that the basics should work.
