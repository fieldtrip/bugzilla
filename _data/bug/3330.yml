          This is a known issue on OS X in combination with R2017. It is possible to recompile the SPM8 mex files on R2017. We have not yet been able to get a set of mex files that works both on older and newer MATLAB versions.

          please note that the external/spm8 mex files are not compiled by ft_compile_mex. You will have to look at SPM for compilation instructions.
