        thetext: "If you got raw data, call megplanar and then combineplanar, checkdata complaints that you provided ctf data as input instead of ctf planar. The problem is caused in ft_senstype which checks the .grad field, in which channel labels are still left as they originally were. \n\nA proposed fix would be to change the recursion of ft_senstype to first check data.label rather than data.grad. \n\nJohanna encountered the same problem with her Nottingham data."

        thetext: megplanar should incorporate the balancing matrix in the gradiometer array and also change the labels. Isn't this the case? i.e. ft_apply_montage should be called in ft_megplanar on both the trial data and the grad-field).

          hmm, yea, probably my bug is related to the fact that my data has no M* sensors anymore, just HLC sensors... must be a bug I introduced in my own script.
          I'll mark this as invalid as long as I cannot reproduce it with proper data, sorry for the confusion!

          hm okay, reproduced :/

          the problem is in line 138 of ft_senstype. the function wants to infer the senstype from hdr, which labels did not get converted to planar labels

          -- cut --
          if isdata
            % preferably look at the data and not the header for the grad, because it might be re-balanced and/or planar
            if isfield(input, 'hdr')
              input = input.hdr;
              isheader = true;
          -- cut --

          I do not get that comment, if the data is planar, ft_senstype should return XXX_planar


          how to avoid this?

        thetext: "I quickly looked at my scripts on my Nottingham data, and it seems my workaround also involved removing the hdr which had original labels causing combineplanar to think it was non-planar data.\nI did it something like this:  \n\ndata.grad=data.hdr.grad\ndata=rmfield(data,'hdr')\ndata1=ft_megplanar(cfg,data)\ndata2=ft_combineplanar(cfg,data1)\n\nI ran into this about 3 weeks ago, but had a few other things different than normal so didn't realise it might be a bug, I thought it was something weird I was doing elsewhere."

        thetext: OK, I don't see a reason why the data.hdr should prevail over the data.grad, so I changed the order in the if/else tree. This solves this problem
