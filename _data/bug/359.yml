        thetext: "the wiki contains a description of the fieldtrip code organisation. We want to try and make the colors consistent throughout, hence the color scheme. Furthermore, the figure with the modules should be updated to reflect all modules. \n\nBut with the new plans for the contrib section, it would make sense to make a new figure that not only listst the modules, but also the contrib and possibly the external toolboxes. \n\nThis should be part of the contrib documentation redesign. I'll draw a sketch for you tomorrow."

        thetext: I have updated the figure, but not with the prescribed colorscheme. There are too many deviations from the scheme on the wiki and I find it too difficult to stick to it.
