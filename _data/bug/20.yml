          currently the documentation does not list the default options for most options

          for the options that do have defaults mentioned, these are inconsistently formatted

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
