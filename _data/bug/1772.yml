          Hi Gianni,
          Yes I did modify two FT functions I attached. I didn't go further with the fix because it only happened to me with one subject. Let me know if it works for you.

          Thanks, pal. I don't remember which scan it was, but I come across the same issue again, I'll try out your solution
