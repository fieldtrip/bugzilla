        thetext: "FT_DIPOLESIMULATION allows for multiple dipoles, however it's not clear how to specify that. \nThe help page does not give information on multiple dipoles while the example on the wiki page \nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/compute_forward_simulated_data_and_apply_a_dipole_fit\ndoes not work.\n\nIt says to specify:\ncfg.dip.mom = [      % each row represents [qx1 qy1 qz1 qx2 qy2 qz2]\n   1 0 0 0 0 0       % this is how signal1 contributes to the 6 dipole components\n   0 0 0 1 0 0       % this is how signal2 contributes to the 6 dipole components\n   ]';               % note, it should be transposed\nhowever, the code wants one vector (line 193):\nrepmat(dipmom{trial}(i:3:end),1,nsamples)\n\nI guess the wiki page should read\ncfg.dip.mom = [1 0 0 1 0 0];\n\nPlease, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThanks,\n\nGio"

        thetext: resolved, but the help is really not clear, to me it looks like dipole moment should be a matrix, but instead it should be a concatenation of arrays

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
