          I'm struggling with ft_sourcestatistics within subject. If I run ft_sourceanalysis without setting cfg.rawtrial = 'yes'; and calculate, say, NAI, the result looks fine.

          If I run ft_sourceanalysis with just adding cfg.rawtrial = 'yes';, and run ft_sourcestatistics between pre and post, the result looks completely different from NAI calculated without cfg.rawtrial = 'yes';. When I'm using the older version of FT, NAI and stat looked similar if I remember correctly...

          The attached file includes data and script for the comparison.

        thetext: Bug does not seem to be a problem anymore as output is highly similar (r=-0.99) in both cases. The correlation is only inversed now because in the test-script the difference between post and pre is plotted while the stat values are calculated on the difference between pre and post (A-B vs B-A).

          (In reply to Jim Herring from comment #4)
          Dear Jim

          Thank you so much for taking time to test the code. Now I updated my
          FT repository, and found that r=-0.99.

          Still, left-right of the estimated source seems to be flipped in both
          averaged and single-trial cases. Iso-contour map suggests strong
          activation in the left hMT+, but the estimated source is at around the
          right hMT+.

          When I run the test code with older FT (13/07/30 version), activity in
          the left hMT+ was estimated correctly (with LCMV averaged source
          analysis not with LCMV single source analysis).

          Can you imagine what's the problem?

          kaoru
