          The following change breaks three test scripts on the dashboard.

          http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/diff?spec=svn7233&r=7232&format=side&path=/trunk/forward/ft_headmodel_localspheres.m&old_path=/trunk/forward/ft_headmodel_localspheres.m&old=7123

          because vol is still empty on line 65. I changed the unit handling in the code into

          --------

          if isempty(unit)
            geometry = ft_convert_units(geometry);  % ensure that the geometry has units
            unit     = geometry.unit;               % also use these units for the volume conductor
          else
            % convert the input geometry to the desired units
            geometry = ft_convert_units(geometry, unit);
          end

          % ensure that all defaults have the same user-defined units
          radius    = ft_getopt(varargin, 'radius',    scalingfactor('cm', unit) * 8.5);
          maxradius = ft_getopt(varargin, 'maxradius', scalingfactor('cm', unit) * 20);
          baseline  = ft_getopt(varargin, 'baseline',  scalingfactor('cm', unit) * 5);

          I made another change to make the three functions behave the same. With the previous commit there was a conversion of the input geometry, whereas with the other two there was (is) not. Now in all three there is no conversion.

          We should together have a look at the unit handling in these functions, as I think it is still not perfect. E.g. if the input geometry has units, and the user specifies something else, the result is inconsistent. I don't know whether the input will or can always have units. Is it always a struct?

          I also notice that fns use units rather than unit. And that quite a few are not fully documented, e.g. ft_headmodel_localspheres does not have unit in the help. I suggest we sit down together and make the changes such that we both agree to the documentation and implementation. Not urgent, though.

          the units were not copied from of the input geometry, nor estimated. This commit below fixes it, and also allows ft_convert_units to work on a struct array (needed for concentric spheres).
