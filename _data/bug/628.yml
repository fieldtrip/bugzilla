          With no pinpointable cause...

          The weird thing is that, on "Edit page", all the content still is there. This is what solves the issue for a single page:
          - Edit page, remove all content (Ctrl-X, so you still have it in your clipboard) and put in something like 'test'
          - Save page
          - Edit page again, Ctrl-V to get back the original content
          - Save page
          - Now the content re-appears, but ToC is gone (???)
          - Edit page again, don't do anything to it
          - Save page
          - Now ToC re-appears as well.
