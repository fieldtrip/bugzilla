          I'm trying to run my analyses on a machine with faster hardware, but this means switching from a full Matlab 2013a license to a Matlab home license (R2015b). In both cases I'm running Windows 7 (pro). The Matlab home license has the following toolboxes installed: curve fitting, signal processing, statistics and machine learning, and wavelet. Is there another toolbox needed? I have a script that previously ran fine with fieldtrip version 20140316. Now it won't run at all with that version. I have better luck with version 20160123, but I still run into the problems below.

          The script seems to get all the way through a call to ft_freqanalysis, but then hangs indefinitely, never moving on the next command, returning to the command prompt, or generating any error message.

          Also, the following error appears if I call on ft_singleplotTFR:

          Undefined function or variable 'rgb2hsv'.

          Error in ft_plot_matrix (line 237)
                hsvcdat = rgb2hsv(rgbcdat);

          Error in ft_singleplotTFR (line 463)
            ft_plot_matrix(xvector, yvector, datamatrix,
            'clim',[zmin,zmax],'tag','cip','highlightstyle',cfg.maskstyle,'highlight', mask)

        thetext: "Hi Jen,\n\nOn http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/requirements you can find the requirements. In principle your new platform sounds ok to me, although I don't know the differences between the home, academic and other versions.\n\nAh, searching my own laptop for the file you mention I see that a copy is here\n\n/Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/toolbox/matlab/images/rgb2hsv.m\n\nwhich means that it is in the image processing toolbox.\n\n>> help images\n  Image Processing Toolbox\n  Version 8.1 (R2012b) 20-Jul-2012 \n\n\nBut there are also copies here\n/Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/mcr/toolbox/matlab/images/rgb2hsv.m\n/Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/toolbox/distcomp/array/+parallel/+internal/+flowthrough/rgb2hsv.m\n/Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/toolbox/distcomp/gpu/@gpuArray/rgb2hsv.m\n/Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/toolbox/distcomp/parallel/@codistributed/rgb2hsv.m\n/Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/toolbox/eml/lib/matlab/specfun/rgb2hsv.m\n\nso it seems that it is not unique to the image processing toolbox. But my MATLAB installation is using the one from images:\n>> which rgb2hsv.m\n/Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/toolbox/matlab/images/rgb2hsv.m\n\nand you lack that toolbox."

        thetext: "since we don't want to rely on math works toolboxes too much (also for in house use, since we have a limited number of toolbox licenses), I looked for a drop-in replacement. We have more of those drop-in replacement functions and keep them in external/stats, external/signal. \n\nI now made an exteral/images and implemented a rgb2hsv replacement function.\n\nmac011> svn commit\nAdding         images\nAdding         images/README\nAdding         images/rgb2hsv.m\nSending        stats/README\nTransmitting file data ...\nCommitted revision 11124.\n\nIt will be in the next release.

I only tested some simple use cases (comparing to the math works version output), but not extensively. Please let me know if you encounter problems with it."
