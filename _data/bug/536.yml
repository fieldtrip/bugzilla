          I'm using fieldtrip-20110315 on a Mac Pro running MATLAB 7.11 and OS X 10.6.6.

          ft_connectivityanalysis does not accept input from ft_freqanalysis when cfg.method='wavelet', cfg.output='fourier', cfg.keeptrials='yes', cfg.keeptapers='yes'.

          I get this error:

          	??? Reference to non-existent field 'cumtapcnt'.
          	
          	Error in ==> ft_checkdata>fixcsd at 833
          	    nrpt = length(data.cumtapcnt);
          	
          	Error in ==> ft_checkdata at 594
          	    data = fixcsd(data, cmbrepresentation, channelcmb);
          	
          	Error in ==> univariate2bivariate at 29
          	        data    = ft_checkdata(data, 'cmbrepresentation', 'full');
          	
          	Error in ==> ft_connectivityanalysis at 234
          	          [data, powindx, hasrpt] = univariate2bivariate(data, 'fourierspctrm', 'crsspctrm', dtype, 'cmb', cfg.channelcmb);

          It works when cfg.output='powandcsd', as seen in http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=535

          If I may ask a question in this bug report, what's so bad about wavelets? Or to put it a different way, why do you (J-M Schoffelen) prefer multitapers? I'm fine with using multitapers instead of wavelets, and I read in van Vugt et al., 2007 (J Neurosci Methods) that multitapers are frequency sensitive, which sounds like a good thing. I was using wavelets for testing my scripts because there were fewer setup options, but if I actually decide to use multitapers, I'm confused about how to choose between dpss, hanning, etc. I guess I need to do some learning and testing on my own (they don't call it reSEARCH for nothing).

          Let me know if you need more info.
          Cheers,
          Matt

          It should do so now. I had to make some small changes to ft_checkdata, and ft_freqanalysis to fix it. Moreover, I committed some small changes to ft_connectivityanalysis which attempt to address some issues (which ones I forgot)...

          I generally prefer multitapers because they allow for better control of the time-frequency trade-off, whereas the time-frequency trade off for wavelets is static, and defined by only 1 parameter, the width.

          With multitapers you can separately address the time sensitivity (t_ftimwin), and the frequency sensitivity (tapsmofrq)

          Looks like this is fixed, ft_connectivityanalysis runs on wavelet data. And thanks for the multitaper insight.
