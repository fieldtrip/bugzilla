          Hi Till,
          Thanks for spotting this.  I'm able to confirm your finding, and also that these NaN values occur in the 'old' way of doing bemcp headmodels as well.  The dipoli method does not have a similar .mat field in which to assess if it went ok or not.  In all cases, ft_prepare_mesh is called and this results in a bnd(1) which is not optimal (spikes coming out of the head).  Here is my test function for anyone else to try:

          %%
          load standard_mri

          cfg           = [];
          cfg.output    = {'brain','skull','scalp'};
          segmentedmri  = ft_volumesegment(cfg, mri);

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method = 'bemcp';
          vol1 = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, segmentedmri);
          % vol1.mat are all NaN

          cfg = [];
          cfg.method = 'dipoli';
          vol2 = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, segmentedmri);
          % looks ok, but no .mat to assess

          % old way
          cfg=[];
          cfg.numvertices=3000;
          bnd=ft_prepare_mesh(cfg,segmentedmri);
          % ft_plot_mesh(bnd(1)) shows that the segmentation did not go well.

          segmentedmri.bnd=bnd;
          cfg=[];
          cfg.method='bemcp';
          vol1o=ft_prepare_bemmodel(cfg,segmentedmri);
          % vol1o.mat also all NaN

          In external/bemcp is a test script called
          bemcp_example.m .
          This works fine until after ft_prepare_bemmodel,
          but the meshes are just spheres geometrically well
          separated ("onion").

          The problem is that the code from the website
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/headmodel_eeg
          really works (it uses dipoli). But you said, one
          does not have a success/fail flag for dipoli ?
          So if the mashes have sikes coming out of the
          head dipoli should fail or maybe it has some
          safeguards. This is a bit worrying altogether.
          Actually a chinese collaborator of mine found
          this problem. And we both are NOT experts on
          bem.

          Many thanks, Till

          Hi Johanna,

          Could you post the specific segmentedmri an the meshes on home/common with the test script?

          I wonder whether there is something wrong with the segmentation, like some voxels outside the head. Lilla (CC) and me are working on improving the handling of the segmentations, but I hope we did not temporarily  introduce a bug.

          If the segmentation has some rogue voxels, one of the inner meshes may stick out the outer meshes. The BEM (any one of them) requires the meshes to be nested, which is then not the case any more. At this moment there is only a very limited sanity check on the meshes, as those checks take quite some time. It is  on the todo list to implement these sanity checks, at least to allow the user to do them him/herself.

           Robert

          interestingly, in line 513 of ft_volumesegment scalpmask still shows the little bar at the head. However, volumethreshold(scalpmask) in line 509 should remove the "little parts" outside of the head. Is it possible that something is not working right at volumethreshold and volumefillholes just before that? Jan-Mathijs, could you, please, look at it?

          The bar at the top is indeed a nasty one, but a good example of what can go wrong. I recall having edited away in 2001 manually with some matlab code. Too bad I did not have the JM editor back then.

          It also calls for some checks when the mesh is made from the segmentation.

          E.g. with bwlabeln -> how many clusters are there? (should be one per tissue type).

          Just a reminder:
          The test script bemcp_example.m in external/bemcp, shows
          that bemcp basically works with the chosen spherical
          geometry. Therefore if the segmentation is OK for
          a real geometry, but bemcp fails, then something very subtle
          is going on.

          hi all,

          first of all I re-run bemcp on the standard_mri in the template directory and I got the matrix singularity problem and the NaNs in the matrix. The earlier artifact of the segmentation (caused by the bar in the mri) is gone, but the surfaces are really close to each other (see attached jpg.) I was wondering if this caused the problem. Therefore, I run bemcp also on the tutorial segmentation (in home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp/tutorial/headmodel_eeg/segmentedmri) where I am almost sure that the segmentation is fine. However, I got the same error! I got the warning message and the matrix is full of NaNs.

          Is it possible that somehow bemcp is just not working properly?

          I assign this bug back to joint development user.

        thetext: "(In reply to Johanna from comment #23)\n\nYou are right, there was a stupid error in volumethreshold. I fixed it. Furthermore, the dipole part was failing because of a correctly detected problem with the meshes. At the bottom of the head the brain and skull were going too far down, causing the meshes to touch the skin surface. \n\nI updated the segmentation code, a bit like the strategy at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/natmeg/dipolefitting#construct_the_eeg_volume_conduction_model\n\n\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit\nSending        forward/ft_headmodel_dipoli.m\nSending        private/volumethreshold.m\nSending        test/test_bug1954.m\nTransmitting file data ...\nCommitted revision 10238."

          seems to work now, and great addition to check the overlapping boundaries.
