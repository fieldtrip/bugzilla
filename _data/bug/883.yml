          I suspect this due to the general memory management of matlab. Looking into the mex file I see that is uses mxCallc. According to my own knowledge and http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/2655 that should result in MATLAB freeing the memory again.

          In the m file there are no persistent or global variables being used, so the memory cannot stick (otherwise than matlab general being sloppy in clearing the data).

          To speed up MATLAB from freeing the memory, I will do an explicit mxFree in the read_24bit and read16_bit mex files.

        thetext: Apparently the mex-files for other platforms still need to be recompiled. But I am closing this bug, finding outdated mex-files is already another bug.
