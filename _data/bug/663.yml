          (In reply to comment #9)

          so the code works when reading in everything anew.

          The planar layout is not really nice, the dH and dV are diagonally shifted. Better would be to have the channels next to each other. But I checked a ctf151 dataset, and it has the same automatic planar layout. So it is consistent.

          I suggest not to provide a yokogawa64 layout and certainly not a planar version. Since the code now works (albeit not with perfect results), this bug can be closed.
