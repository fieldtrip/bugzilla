          we might want to start with an example script on the wiki, that has fewer requirements in terms of formatting.

          Are there publicly shared NIRS datasets?

        thetext: "We can use our data - we have several example datasets. I would propose to use two of them. Both are measured on the motor cortex. One is a two-channel recording, the other is a 24-channel recording. Basic analysis would be pretty simple (bandpass-filtering, average, voila). The two-channel recordings has a shallow-channel, allowing for correction of superficial skin activation, i.e. a somewhat more advanced option. The 24-channel measurement can then be taken as an example for a multichannel recording and plotting, maybe even for stats. I propose the following:\n\n1. intro to NIRS and paradigm\n2. single channel analysis on the deep channel, i.e. basic processing pipeline\n3. short-channel subtraction \n4. 24-channel and topographic plotting\n\nin a separate tutorial we could cover advanced short-channel correction i.e. with several channels and different techniques and stats and those things. What do you guys think?"

          Our internal, incomplete FieldTrip tutorial

          I started with a tutorial for courses we gave already last year. This is the last version (Aug 2016) - not complete, but can serve as a start/

        thetext: "Hi Jorn,\n\nGreat to see that there is already something that close to a NIRS tutorial. \n\nFor didactical reasons I think it is better to start with the 2-channel dataset. Plotting/exploring the data is easy using standard MATLAB, which keeps the complexity low.\n\nThe 24-channel requires another way of exploring/visualizing (i.e. layout and multiplot). It might also require a more elaborate explanation on how opcodes (transmitters/receivers) relate to channels. \n\nBoth are relevant and valuable, but I think that the gradual build up of complexity is better served by starting with the 2-channel one. And I am not sure whether there should be \"fancy stuff\" for the 2-channel dataset, or whether that should be left for the user (i.e. as an in-line exercise)."
