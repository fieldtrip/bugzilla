        thetext: On http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/realtime/tmsi it describes that there is a tmsidriver, which should be named tmsi2ft. It should be changed in the code and wiki documentation.

        thetext: |-
          There is now an alternative implementation of a TMSi acquisition driver which is based on the same framework as the one for Biosemi, Emotiv, Neurosky, ...
          That application is called tmsi2ft, which is consistent with the rest.

          The tmsidriver should stick around at least until tmsi2ft has been thoroughly tested, or even better, someone picks up the maintance of all these tools.
