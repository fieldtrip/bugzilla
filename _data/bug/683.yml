          Hi, this is not a bug, but a suggestion. It would be very interesting to have an option of movie plot for time-frequency analysis (i.e. ft_movieplotTFR).

          Cheers,
          Gustavo

          Hi Jorn

          I noticed this old suggestion in bugzilla. Can you please post Gustavo when you are done implementing the stuff for bug 1036?

          thanks,
          Robert

        thetext: sure, I'll will. Still takes some time though, cause I want to deal with some older bugs first.

        thetext: "In principle, the moviefunction I made can already make movies. It still lacks the possibility of storing the movie. How should storing be done? Should the function return a big matrix, or should the movie be automatically stored as a .avi? \n\nI still need to work on restructuring the funciton, i.e. atm source- and sensormovies are all in one function. Should I first upload the moviefunction and make the other functions a wrapper around the new function, or first restructure?\n\nAdditionally, there are some more options I would like to add to make it a real-kickass function (custom colormap, perspective switch button for 3D data, online limitation of time axis, ...)\n\nWith regard to the big conference coming up, would it be a good idea to advertise the updated moviefunctions to the list when it's finished? Would be great to see some moving TFRs/beamformed results at HBM, BioMag, SfN or other conferences, right?\n\n@Gustavo: If you want a sneak peak of the new function, let me know! I can send you the (yet unpolished) function. It would actually be great if someone would already work with it to get feedback on other functionality that could be added, or simply on bugs.\n\n@Robert: Next Wednesday I'll also show you guys the current status"

          @ Jörn:

          I'm working with my TFRs at the source-level, and would also love to have such a function ^_^.   I wouldn't mind contributing to this/helping out and am eager to learn, if you think I'd be useful on this?

          Hey,

          yes, in fact I plan to work tomorrow on it again and get the sh** finally done the next weeks before summer :)
          there is a function called "moviefunction" within FT since a couple of months (who, it seems like it's ~ 2 years already...), which has some basic functionality. I need to re-do the GUI to adhere to some new FieldTrip guidelines (that Robert and me made a last year or so), and re-think some aspects of the user interface. Nietzsche, maybe we can sit tomorrow to discuss what exactly would be nice to have?
