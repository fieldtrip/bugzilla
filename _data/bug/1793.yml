          It pertains to the section "Below you can see a solution for this. Each trial represented as a separate data-structure, and then the trials are combined into a cell-array. The output is stored in timelockFIC and timelockFC for the fully incongruent and the fully congruent condition."

          This causes the tutorial to break further down in the code (around megplanar, which now gets a cell-array as input).

          sorry, I made the change because of bug1617. I restored the old revision until I can solve the problem in bug1617 more carefully.
