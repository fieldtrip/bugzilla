          1) include advice on peak detection of artifact

          (this may be a separate bug:)
          2) implement how best to save out peaks, and the params used for peak-detection into a cfg, to enable the possiblity to trace back what you did.

          (I've been using dss lately, with advice/code from Jan-Mathijs.)

          See beginning of 'example script' at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dss.

          Perhaps the sub-section of ECG peak detection, as it calls some extra functions and private code at the moment in a 'hacky' way, should be made into a main-level function ft_prepare_dss_peaks ?  But it would output 'p' and 'params' which are not standard output for a ft_* function.

          (In reply to comment #2)
          Finished and committed points (2) and (3).  Output now comes easily out of cfg.artfctdef.zvalue.  SVN commit 5421.   Wiki updated.

          Point (1) (GUI for preproc adjustment on the fly) seemed too much work for not enough benefit, and I found a more robust way of preproc settings which seems more generally applicable for my data, thus "won't fix" for the time being.

          Still to-do:  put example dataset on wiki and run through this example (possibly with figures).

          It is not yet finished in these ways:

          1) As mentioned in comment 3, the example dataset does not exist.  So, I could just remove mention of that, and say to use on your own data.

          2) The wiki reflects the way the code currently works, but ft_artifact_zvalue should be still changed, as mentioned in comment 4, and subsequently wiki changed to match it.

          3) The part in the wiki where it states:  addpath ~/mfiles/dss_1-0 should be changed to addpath of the fieldtrip/external/dss folder.

          This is back on the radar, and will be worked on in:

          https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/1549

          Once this PR is merged, this bug can be closed.
