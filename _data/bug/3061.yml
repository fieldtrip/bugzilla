        thetext: "We are experimenting with a http://structure.io scanner for electrodes and head shapes.\n\nIts default output is *.obj. In meshlab it can be converted to *.ply or *.stl (retaining color). \n\nft_read_headshape does not support *.obj yet. It does support ply and stl, but on the ply file it fails and with the stl file the color is not returned. So some code improvements are needed.\n\nThe OBJ format is detailed on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file and http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/obj. It is simple ascii file format but it can contain complex geometries. Also, the color coding is represented in a separate (jpg) file with a mapping between them.\n\nThe ply and stl files contain all data in a single file, hence I suggest to improve the existing implementation for those, rather than making a new reader for the obj files."

          I happen to work with wavefront object files for our 3D visualization. For Matlab, there is a File Exchange toolbox that can read and write these files:

          Please look at the ft_hastoolbox function, add the URL there and toolbox detection code, and call ft_hastoolbox just prior to the actual code in ft_read_headshape to manage the path.

          I suggest to call it "wavefront" in all lower case (and hence fieldtrip/external/wavefront) instead of "WOBJ_toolbox_Version2b" and to add a VERSION file to that directory.

          I just merged https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/101

          We should also add the color mapping to the output head shape, e.g. as headshape.color or head shape.rgb.

          There is now for some formats 'sulc' 'curv' 'area' 'thickness' 'atlasroi' as additional fields (that I am aware of).

          @Jan-Mathijs, is there also (perhaps for FS or Caret) a color mapping that is already added to meshes? If so, we should reuse that field name.

          in caret/workbench speak these files are referred to as 'metric' files (typically with the extension .shape.gii. Specifically, workbench/hcp seems to hold on to the convention Subjectid.L/R.thickness.someresolution.shape.gii, where L/R is either L or R, and some resolution can be something like 'native' or 32k_fs_LR if surface registered to the freesurfer template). Actually, the atlasroi, curv, sulc, and thickness are inspired by FS/workbench I am not aware of another standard name for a metric quantity.

          And of course my whole blabla above does not necessary apply at all, because
          1) the headshape contains both left and right
          2) there's no surface registration involved, doh.

          I am simply thinking of something similar to "headshape.curv" with three RGB columns...
