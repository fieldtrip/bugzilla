          Created attachment 665
          debug.xml file

          On one of the smaller machines (mentat206) I ran out of memory:

          x = ft_read_cifti('tstat1.dtseries.nii')
          Error using nan
          Out of memory. Type HELP MEMORY for your options.
          Error in ft_read_cifti (line 681)
               dat = nan(Ngreynodes,Ntime);

          And on one of the other machines (dccn-c011), I encountered the following error.
          x = ft_read_cifti('tstat1.dtseries.nii')
          Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch.
          Error in ft_read_cifti (line 682)
               dat(greynodeIndex(dataIndex),:) = transpose(data);

          The data I am trying to load are one of the t-statistic images from one of the tfMRI contrasts, which you can (for example) find in:

          /home/mrstats/andmar/data/hcp/data_unpacked/100307/MNINonLinear/Results/tfMRI_LANGUAGE/tfMRI_LANGUAGE_hp200_s8_level2.feat/GrayordinatesStats/cope5.feat

          These are not overly large files and I am currently manipulating many of them simultaneously in memory using my current routines (SPM gifti + nifti routines).

          I have also attached a debug.xml file which was generated as a part of this process. I hope that helps and of course I am happy to run additional tests to help streamline the code.

          with 16gb requested it gets killed
          with 32gb requested it gets killed

          but in both cases I was (just) able to see the error. I'll move to a 64gb session for diagnosis.

          Hi Andre,

          for MEG we don't look at subcortical structures that often, so we don't have combined data. Could you provide an example dataset/file, or an example script that allows us to reproduce? That will save us quite some time.

          Hi Robert,

          You can use this file:

          /home/mrstats/andmar/data/hcp/data_unpacked/100307/MNINonLinear/Results/tfMRI_GAMBLING/tfMRI_GAMBLING_hp200_s8_level2.feat/GrayordinatesStats/cope1.feat/cope1.dtseries.nii

          if you load the image then save it out (without modifying anything), then try to view the volumetric components in workbench, you should be able to recreate the problem.

          Thanks,

          Andre.

          I copied the additional data file to /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/bug2734
           for future reference. I hope that I'll soon find the time to look at it.
