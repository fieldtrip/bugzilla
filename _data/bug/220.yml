        thetext: "As the Nyquist is a hard-limit on the frequencies one can estimated, an error should be thrown when a user accidentally requests it. This sounds like a no-brainer not to do, but if your downsampling a lot mistakes can be made much easier. Someone came to me today who had down-sampled MEG data to 100Hz and forgot about it (as it did not matter at the time), and accidentally estimated up until 70 Hz. \nIt should be a really easy check in an if-construct."

        thetext: Added an error for mtmconvol and mtmfft separately. As soon as specest is fully implemented, these will need to moved/combined.
