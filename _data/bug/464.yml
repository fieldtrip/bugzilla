          Hi Eelke,

          Let's do this one together. Could you make a plan which we can discuss? I'll supervise ;o)

          Some simple suggestions for improvement:
          - Combine the three computing subfunctions into one
          - Remove the loops over frequencies and channels, replace with vector-based code

          I am not entirely sure about the relation between the dimord and the possibility to normalise a coherence spectrum. If the dimord is 'rpt_chan_freq_time', the function refuses to normalise a coherence spectrum. This is because coherence within a single trial does not make sense? I guess we should discuss this.
