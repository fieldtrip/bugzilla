          This happens since the TG upgraded the svn server operating system. Prior to that the OS was probably  not configured to send emails. I tracked it down to one of the svn hooks, which has this

          at now << EOF
          $REPOS/hooks/post-commit-twitter          $REPOS $REV
          $REPOS/hooks/post-commit-autosync         $REPOS $REV
          $REPOS/hooks/post-commit-queue            $REPOS $REV
          EOF

          It is the "at" command that sends the emails, just like "cron" usually sends emails.

          the at manual (man at) does not show an option to prevent emails. So the only option is to make the commands silent. I changed it into

          at now << EOF
          $REPOS/hooks/post-commit-twitter          $REPOS $REV > /dev/null 2>&1
          $REPOS/hooks/post-commit-autosync         $REPOS $REV > /dev/null 2>&1
          $REPOS/hooks/post-commit-queue            $REPOS $REV > /dev/null 2>&1
          EOF

          We'll have to wait until the next commit to see whether this works.
