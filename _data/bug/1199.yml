          since the output scales linearly with the DC, one could do the mtmconvol on an input with ones and then use a moving average convolution and multiply the spectrum at any time-point by the mva.
          Probably the first step can be simplified since the spectrum should be known if input is a vector of ones.

          Dear Martin,

          I have asked Roemer and JM, and it appears it has been discussed during the fieldtrip meeting, and the decision was made not to make the change. Instead, a high-pass filter could be used.

          Best,

          Boris
