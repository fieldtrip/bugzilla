          Hello,

          The following "dummy" code hangs when i is around 12, why? We use slurm. Of course we get the warning that it takes longer to submit the job than it takes to compute it, but that as far as I know that is not a documented reason for the hanging, or?

          Thanks a lot for any help,
          David

          % ******* Script begin ********

          for i=1:10000
              cfg = {};
              for slrnr=1:81
                  cfg{slrnr}.slrnr = slrnr;
              end
              Zout = qsubcellfun(@informationSlurmHCMaskDummy,cfg,'queue','8GB','memreq',1024,'timreq',1024);
          end

          % ******* Script end ********

          % ******* Function begin (new *.m file) ********

          function Zout = informationSlurmHCMaskDummy(cfg)

          Zout = cfg.slrnr;

          Hi David,

          I don't think this issue has anything to do specifically with fieldtrip/qsub, but that it reflects some timeouts in your cluster. Since I don't have access to a slurm cluster, I cannot resolve it. If you still encounter problems, please provide me and Kai (CC) with   more information.

          best regards,
          Robert
