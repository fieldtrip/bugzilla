          I tried connectivity with granger on a dataset with two channels. I get the following error:


          stat = ft_connectivityanalysis(cfg, freq);
          computing multivariate non-parametric spectral factorization on 2 channels
          averaging crsspctrm over rpt
          averaging transfer over rpt
          removing dimension rpt from crsspctrm
          removing dimension rpt from transfer
          ??? Error using ==> reshape
          To RESHAPE the number of elements must not change.

          Error in ==> ft_connectivity_granger at 30
                    zc     = reshape(Z(kk,jj,jj,:) - Z(kk,ii,jj,:).^2./Z(kk,ii,ii,:),[1 1 1 1 siz(5)]);

          Error in ==> ft_connectivityanalysis at 596
                [datout, varout, nrpt] = ft_connectivity_granger(data.transfer, data.noisecov, data.crsspctrm, fs, hasjack, powindx);

          K>> size(Z)

          ans =

               1    64     2     2


          Investigating I found that Z comes from data.noisecov and the leading singleton dimension is added around line 407 of ft_connectivityanalysis which might not be the right thing to do for this field.

          could you upload a freq-structure (with not too many frequency bins) as attachment to this bug?
          Thanks

        thetext: by the way, it typically makes more sense to compute a non-parametric spectral factorization on averaged data, rather than on single trials.
