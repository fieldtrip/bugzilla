          Thanks Daniel for the clarification.

          I guess we should deprecate the old pipeline and update the
          demos scripts + tests. As you know this code well (and better than me)
          would you consider giving it a try?

          Thanks again

          Hi Alexandre,

          We've left the old pipeline intact, so the test scripts will still call
          that.  To use the new pipeline, the vol structure needs to be prepared
          manually as in the following example:

          vol.bnd = bnd;
          vol.cond = [0.33 0.0042 0.33];
          vol.type = 'openmeeg';
          vol.basefile = 'testfile';
          vol.path = './testpath';
          vol.method = 'adjoint';  % or 'hminv'

          This is done instead of using ft_prepare_headmodel or ft_prepare_bemmodel
          because these two functions calculate and import the head matrix.  Importing
          this matrix can be problematic with denser head meshes as Matlab is not well
          known for it's memory management efficiency.

          When calling ft_prepare_leadfield, this vol structure is provided in the cfg
          structure as usual.  However, because the head matrix is missing from this
          manually created vol strucuture, the revised pipeline will be called.  All
          openmeeg inputs and outputs (including the head matrix) will be stored in
          ./testpath and filenames will begin with file.  Note that if the basefile
          and basepath parameters are not provided, the inputs and outputs for
          openmeeg will be stored in a temporary directory and will be deleted at the
          end.  Please see ft_leadfield_openmeeg for more details.

          We are in the process of writing a tutorial that can be posted on the
          fieldtrip website.

          hi Sarang,

          thanks for working on this. I just tried running the demo/tests script
          in the openmeeg folder (openmeeg_meg_leadfield_example.m and
          openmeeg_eeg_leadfield_example.m) and they still fail. I suspect
          issues with surface orientations. Do you confirm that they fail

          also currently broken :(

          Hi everyone,

          Daniel and I just committed our revised OpenMEEG pipeline to the SVN
          repository. The main function is ft_leadfield_openmeeg.m, which involved
          some minor changes to ft_compute_leadfield.m, ft_prepare_vol_sens.m, and a
          couple new functions for working with meshes from various MR segmentation
          tools: ft_import_surf.m and ft_iso2surf.m

          Please let us know in case of any problems! Maybe someone else should
          try it with their own data, before we make an announcement to the general
          mailing list. :-)

           Dear Sarang, Daniel,

            Like Alex I thank you for having devoted time to maintaining the
          OpenMEEG/Fieldtrip connection.
            We were aware from colleagues in Marseille and Lyon that there were
          issues, but had not had the time to look into it.

            It may be of interest to you to know that OpenMEEG will very soon
          have the ability to
            handle non-nested geometries with BEM, and that it may be
          interesting to look into incorporating
            this into Fieldtrip as well !
            Best regards

          | Hi everyone,
          |
          | With my postdoc Daniel Wong, we've been working on a revised OpenMEEG
          | pipeline for FieldTrip, which is based on the previous workflow as
          | well as our own Nutmeg pipeline. As reported by Jean-Michel Badier,
          | it seems that the FieldTrip-OpenMEEG bindings have been broken for a
          | few months in FieldTrip's SVN, and we were able to correct this as
          | well.
          |
          | This involves modifications to the OpenMEEG-specific code in
          | ft_compute_leadfield.m, a revised pipeline script, and a dependency
          | on the free iso2mesh package (for mesh manipulation).
          |
          | Since we think these developments will be of general interest, we
          | think it would be worth incorporating into the official version of
          | FieldTrip. If you guys agree, I was wondering what would be the best
          | way to validate and contribute our code. I do have SVN developer
          | access, but hesitate to contribute such significant developments
          | without consulting with you guys first!
          |
          | All the best,
          | Sarang

          I see a number of items that need to be followed up

          1) ensure that test scripts run through
          1a) make an inventory of test scripts that are specific to openmeeg
          1b) make an inventory of test scripts that relate to openmeeg
          1c) make new test scripts where needed

          2) review the code changes and ensure that they are consistent with fieldtrip style

          3) ensure all present documentation is up to date

          4) make a tutorial


          Regarding 2: I suspect that some "options/features" that are now passed in the vol structure would have to be handled through ft_prepare_headmodel and ft_headmodel_openmeeg.

          Regarding 4: is a new tutorial needed? Is it possible to extend or improve http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/headmodel_eeg. On the long run (=years) it is a lot of work to keep all those tutorials up to date, therefore I woudl prefer making it part of the existing tutorials. We will also have a SimBio FEM tutorial, which needs to be fitted in somehow.

          Lol at the video :D

          We can definitely add on to http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/headmodel_eeg for the tutorial.  I wasn't planning on writing all the initial coregistration steps which is currently explained quite well.  I was thinking more along the lines of describing how segmentation is done using the 3rd party software (much of this is actually already written for the Nutmeg website), how to mesh that data in FieldTrip (with our new functions), and how to call the new BEM pipeline.

          I can modify the ft_prepare_headmodel and ft_headmodel_openmeeg functions to provide the new vol structure.  I haven't touched them yet as their main purpose seems to be to call the head matrix computation in the old pipeline and I didn't want to mess with that until we were sure that our new pipeline is working.  So for now, I'll probably add a flag to call our pipeline, and then eventually make that the default as we phase out the old pipeline.

          regarding pipeline flow and documentation: we often have the situation that a pipeline consists of N steps, each with multiple options. So

          step 1 -> step 2 -> step 3

          where either 1a, b, c are combined with  2a or b, and 3a, b, or c. Working them all out results in 3*2*3 possible flows, which is impossible to maintain as documentation.

          Important is to use a consistent style of describing the steps, as then it is possible to start another piece of documentation with "we are going to continue at step X" or "as alternative to 2a in this pipelien, lets look at 2b (without redoing 1 and 3)".

          How does the structure of the http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/headmodel_eeg match with your view on it?

          For the headmodel_eeg tutorial, I'm proposing the following modifications:

          1. For the segmentation, I was thinking we could give that it's own page/sub-pages (linked from headmodel_eeg), covering the different options (there's 4 including the pre-existing SPM segmentation).

          2. The meshing section can be expanded to cover the new meshing tools - ft_iso2surf and ft_import_surf, which are used depending on whether the 3rd party segmentation software gave us a segmented tissue volume or a mesh.
          We could potentially try having these functions called from ft_prepare_mesh, with ft_iso2surf falling back on the old meshing function if the ISO2MESH toolbox is not detected.  (The new meshing functions are more robust at repairing errors in the mesh)  @Robert: What do you think?

          3.  The rest of the steps in headmodel_eeg leaves us off exactly where we need to be before calling the BEM computation (once I modify ft_prepare_headmodel and ft_headmodel_openmeeg).  Since the vol structure will have been set up by ft_prepare_headmodel and ft_headmodel_openmeeg, I only need to specify in the tutorial what flag needs to be specified in those two functions to call the new pipeline.

          Much of the new pipeline was designed to be as similar as possible to the old pipeline, so I don't foresee the need for major changes for tighter integration with the existing fieldtrip workflow.

          sorry, that was a false alarm. The error was in my test script. It actually works fine now, both with the old ft_prepare_bemmodel and with the new (and more generic) ft_prepare_headmodel.

          there will be an "option 1, 2, 3 - xxx" with xxx
          1) dipoli
          2) openmeeg
          3) bemcp

          all three would be for EEG and on the same geometry.

          Note to Jim: I have the following in my .profile, and have my .bashrc symlinked to my .profile

          export OPENMEEG=/opt/openmeeg/2.1.0
          export PATH=$PATH:$OPENMEEG/bin
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PATH:$OPENMEEG/lib

          Furthermore, there is the openmeeg module, so you should also (instead of this) be able to do "module load openmeeg"

          In a recent MEG meeting Jim mentioned that "it just works". But a colleague from NatMEG later ran into a problem (2 weeks ago) that it did not work for elekta data. I did a small fix, but the error back then suggested that it would have only worked for 4D data with magnetometers.

          Hi,

          I believe the current version in the repository assumes that there are only magnetometers and no reference sensors, so this likely means that all the additional possibilities with Elekta (gradiometers only, gradiometers + magnetomers, reference sensors) are not currently implemented.

          We made some updates (not yet submitted as they are not yet validated) so that things work for CTF systems, both with and without synthetic gradient correction. It shouldn't be too much work for us to get Elekta support fully implemented after this.

          From March 1, I will be at Aarhus where we there is an Elekta system, so I am happy to develop and test any further updates that the various Elekta permutations will require.

          Cheers,
          Sarang

          no you should not transpose the tra or initial lf

          the tea is channels*coils, the initial lf is coils*orientations, the resulting lf is channels*orientations.

          In this specific code (ft_prepare_leadfield) it is computed for many dipoles at once, and the 4452 is actually 1484 grid positions times 3 orientations per grid position. There are 149 channels, and 298 coils.
