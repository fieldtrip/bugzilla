          Some functions required to generate the lead field of simbio FEM method oughta be better encapsulated (e.g. vgrid, ipm_linux_opt). Make sure that the shell wrapper sets the proper environmental variables (libraries, binaries, etc...).
          All has to work perfectly from other users' accounts.
