          at this moment ft_channelrepair contains

          if iscell(cfg.neighbours)
              warning('Neighbourstructure is in old format - converting to structure array');
              cfg.neighbours = fixneighbours(cfg.neighbours);
          end


          and potentially other functions have a similar piece of code. Since the neighbours always "enter" the function through the cfg.neighbours field, ft_checkconfig is able to always convert it. This is similar to fixing cfg.grad and cfg.elec.

          Hey Robert,

          good idea, but there is a problem in ft_prepare_neighbours. ft_prepare_neighbours only returns the neighbour structure, *not* the cfg. The most consistent way, also with respect to all other ft_ functions, would be to change the output argument to a cfg. However, this will lead to much trouble concerning backward compatibility.

          Btw, the reason why ft_prepare_neighbours might need fixneighbours is that someone may want to load a template that is still in old format. I doubt that anyone does, so another possibility would be to just delete&try

          For all other functions, I will change this.
