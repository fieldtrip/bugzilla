        thetext: "The test function test_tutorial_spike_Neurosim.m does not work. \n(in ./contrib/spike/test/)\n\nIt relies on ft_trialfun_general. However, trialfun general calls ft_read_header to get sampling rate information.\n\nSince we removed filetype 'neurosim_spikes' from ft_read_header yesterday, it no longer works.\n\nThis may also be true for other spike formats (that do not store spikes in a continuous manner).\n\nPossible options:\n-Put neurosim_spikes back in ft_read_header, (and in ft_read_data)\n\n-Never use ft_trialfun_general\n\n-Change ft_trialfun_general to fix this specific case (a bit of a hack)."

          PS
          I'll have to commit the changes first. So the bug is not apparent yet.

          I seem to quite bad at actually finding the "resolved" button...
