          I added some code in ft_preproc_highpassfilter that checks whether the calculated filter coefficients are stable (=whether all poles of the filter are strictly within the unit circle). If this is not the case (as in the originally given example), the function reports a corresponding error.

          I am not 100% sure about the cause of this problem, since a proper Butterworth filter should always be stable, but I vaguely remember that in some cases, a digital filter that was derived from a stable analog prototype (through bilinear transformation) can be instable. I think this comes from numerical precision when calculating the coefficients, and it *might* be possible to use more exact formulas (e.g. expand the analog filter before transforming).
