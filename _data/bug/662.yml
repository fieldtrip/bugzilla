        thetext: "... instead of using its own implementation inside megplanar_sincos. At the moment it does\n\nfor i=1:Ngrad\n  for j=(i+1):Ngrad\n    distance(i,j) = norm(pnt(i,:)-pnt(j,:));\n    distance(j,i) = distance(i,j);\n  end\nend\n\nfprintf('minimum distance between gradiometers is %6.2f %s\\n', min(distance(find(distance~=0))), grad.unit);\nfprintf('maximum distance between gradiometers is %6.2f %s\\n', max(distance(find(distance~=0))), grad.unit);\n\n% select the channels that are neighbours, channel is not a neighbour of itself\nneighbsel = distance<cfg.neighbourdist;\nfor i=1:Ngrad\n  neighbsel(i,i) = 0;\nend\nfprintf('average number of neighbours is %f\\n', sum(neighbsel(:))./size(neighbsel,1));\n\nwher the default cfg.neighbourdist is 4 or 40. This fails for yokogawa64, and might be suboptimal for other systems as well. The optimal neighbours for megplanar are probably the same as for clustering. \n\nNote that the decision might be that the user should be forced to call ft_neighbourselection manually instead of doing it automatically.\n\nI guess this needs some thinking, followed by some discussion."
