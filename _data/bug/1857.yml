        thetext: "I investigated Boris' scripts, and know how to remove it. Since the testing and reporting are asynchronous from commits, I consider it too difficult to automatize it. But I can do it manually. \n\nI have just removed all test results prior to revision 7000. \n\nIf - in the future - you see test results that are outdated and reflecting test scripts that have been removed, please ask me and I'll again do it manually."
