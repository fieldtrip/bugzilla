        thetext: "When reading a 4D header with digitized electrodes I often get an error.

          Hi
          I found this bug with unusual digitization data. I didn't attach data as I don't have trimmed data handy. if necessary I'll prepare some.
          thanks, Yuval

          Hi Yuval,

          Are you by any chance using a very old version of the code? I don't find the lines you mentioned in a more recent version. I may have encountered this issue before, and changed it already. Could you confirm the outdated version and try with the most recent one?
