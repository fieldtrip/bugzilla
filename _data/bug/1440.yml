          A simple warning of a undetected filetype should be given, instead, it results in an error:
          ??? Invalid field name: 'could_not_determine_filetype_of_~_storage_common_dataarx_kahana'.

          Error in ==> warning_once at 82
            previous.(fname).timeout = now+timeout;

          Error in ==> ft_filetype at 1019
            warning_once(sprintf('could not determine filetype of %s', filename));


          Eelke, you worked on fixname yesterday right? I set it to critical becauce fixname and warning once are used in so many locations (I think).

          Hey, what about using genvarname instead (http://www.mathworks.nl/help/techdoc/ref/genvarname.html) in the warning_once function (and possibly elsewhere)?

          Adding Joern (who originally wrote warning_once) and Robert (who originally wrote fixname) to CC as well, perhaps they had a particular reason for not using genvarname.

          (BTW, I did change fixname now to also strip ~ characters.)

          Hmmm, private/fixname.m got updated, but /fileio/private/fixname.m didn't.
          Which is weird, since the autosync property is set. (svn proplist filename)

          Eelke can you check if both fixname.m's above are the same in your dev-copy?

          Nevermind, there was a conflict in my fixnames, after reverting they both synced properly. Also, bug is confirmed fixed, I closed it.

          Still though, weird it didn't popup before, those paths (with the home-dir-~) have always been the same.

          OK :) Indeed, my fixnames were identical.

          Closed though this bug may be, the genvarname suggestion above still stands. Why not use that? It also seems nice that that one will be updated by mathworks if the rules for valid names change in future releases.

But looking at it, I find it rather ugly.\n\n >> genvarname('jan.mathijs')\nans =\njan0x2Emathijs\n\nAll unaccepted characters are replaced by their hexadeximal counterpart, whereas in fixname they are replaced by an underscore.\n\nThe strategy used in genvarname however is interesting, when compared to fixname. In fixname a list is maintained of all invalid characters that we encountered once upon a time, whereas genvarname does it the other way around and maintains a list of allowed characters.\n\nWe can replace fixname by something like this\n\n\n>> regexp('jan.Mathijs_is#the$example', '\\W')\nans =\n     4    15    19\n\nso \nstr = 'jan.Mathijs_is#the$example';\nstr(regexp(str, '\\W')) = '_';\n\nstr =\njan_Mathijs_is_the_example\n\n\n\n\nshould we reopen and do it like this?"
