        thetext: Arjen and I noticed that dipole fitting was very slow due to (in the iterative loop) warning_once being called. This caused strcmp to be called many times, which made it very slow. I guess it should be possible to speed it up.

        thetext: hm, in your case, strcmp is called only once per function call (to check whether it is a '-clear' call). I am not aware of any tweaks for that :/

          So that means that the function can in principle be made 5x faster, i.e. 10ms rather than 50ms per call.
