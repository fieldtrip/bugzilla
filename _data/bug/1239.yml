          Recently, a bug has appeared with Topoplot functions and the highlightchannel option.
          When cfg.highlightchannel is empty, the Topoplot highlight all channels when it shouldnt highlight anyone.
          Tested with the very last version (-20111220), problem still occurs.
          Thanks

Perhaps to be discussed first."

        thetext: "Hmmmm, I thought I made a rather elaborate set of if loops that would detect it, but I may have skipped this one (as highlighting channels that are made of thin air should not be allowed). \nWe did discuss in the last FT meeting on how to handle the yes/no settings, specifically how to deal with options that have a 'no', or a selection of channels/options :). If I remember correctly, we agreed to remove such cfg options? Because it made a simpler, stricter and more elegant set of if-loops possible, by allowing us to use istrue/isfalse to default such things (and use logical flags in the if-loops)"

          Bug is fixed. Closeable after JM agrees with the last sentence.

          On the restructuring:
          We discussed the following in a meeting a while ago:
          1) options that can be on/off/yes/no/true/false, should be only so and
          2) these options should be passed through istrue, and
          3) the if-statement should be a boolean, i.e. the output of istrue

          For topoplot, the cfg.highlight used to be the option that also immediately defined channels, or was set to 'off'. For compatibility I suggest we don't change it yet to fit the above, the current highlight stuff is about 1,5 years old, maybe we should support it for a little longer?
