        thetext: "Fixed for now, but let's discuss implementation.\n\nFor several sub-folder/modules, there was a call to ft_hastoolbox in ft_defaults, but there was no actual check being performed by ft_hastoolbox. This resulted to several sub-dirs always being added to the path, regardless of whether they were already on it. Hence, they're always at the top of the path. \n\nThe sub-dirs/modules in question:\n- trunk/preproc\n- trunk/inverse\n- trunk/realtime\n- trunk/specest\n- trunk/statfun\n- trunk/trialfun\n\nThe first 4 are actual modules (as documented on the wiki), the last two are more a kind of 'utilities'\n\nThe current structure of ft_hastoolbox distinguishes toolboxes from 'other (sub)directories in fieldtrip'. Modules are considered toolboxes.\n\nFor a toolbox, an existence-on-the-path check is performed by testing the existence of several files on the path, usually 2 or more ft_ functions. \n\nFor a 'other (sub)directory in fieldtrip', an existence-on-the-path check is performed by checking whether the dir in question is on the current matlab path (by parsing the output of 'path').\n\nFor now, I have added the above modules/dir to the path in way identical to the last situation. Even though some of them are modules.\n\nTo discuss:\nFor modules, what is the rationale for checking the existence of an arbitrary set of main-functions instead of the sub-directory. Checking for sub-directories seems safer, as it is more stable. \n\n\n\nPS:\nA part of the cause for all fieldtrip-dirs being put on the top path everytime ft_defaults was called, is that their existence was only checked for the trunk folder being named 'fieldtrip'. I changed this so that it used the actual trunk (like fieldtrip-XXX; sensitive to \\ and / of course)\n\nAlso, there was a typo in the case for FORWARD(was FORMWARD).\n\nAlso, I updated some of the urls to all modules supported in ft_hastoolbox. (multivariate and qsub are not supported in hastoolbox, and spike is missing on the wiki)"
