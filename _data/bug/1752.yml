          Created attachment 331
          example from google search

          This is inspired by the connectivity figures of Ritta Salmelin. See also the attachment.

          Imagine the mean positions of cortical parcels in 3D source space. Project them in 2D along the z-axis, shift them outward to a unit circle, reposition them along the circle to get uniform distances between them.

          The result is useful for plotting connections. You can also imagine manually crafted versions with the "outline" feature of the layout used to visually group them together according to lobe (one circle segment per lobe)

          This can also be done for electrodes (esp. if you don't have too many). For positions in the middle it won't work.

        thetext: The basic functionality is possible. ft_prepare_layout can create a circular layout (but better would be to create your own), and ft_topoplotCC can be used to draw the arrows (the latter now also allows for curved arrows to be drawn, as per the example figure).
