          As of r8179 (https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/diff?spec=svn8179&r=8179&format=side&path=/trunk/ft_prepare_atlas.m), reading the AAL atlas (template/atlas/aal/ROI_MNI_V4.nii) seems to be broken. No matter which anatomical coordinates you put in (e.g. when browsing in sourceplot), the answer is always 'NA' or 'no_label_found'.

          The change seems a small one, but there must have been some reason for it :) Jörn, can you easily fix this?

          Hi Eelke,

          I made the change due to two reasons: first, it obeys the description somewhat further up (around line 600), second I am reading in the atlas from spm8, there it needs to be like that. I was under the impression that an AAL atlas is an AAL atlas, and if it is described and matches one, it should be a general format.

          Of course I could just revert it, or make a general if exist(C{1}{3}) && isnumeric(C{1}{3}) then use the old way else do it the other way, but is there maybe some convention for the AAL atlas?

          I would, but I am rather confused at the moment. The test script reads in a totally different atlas from the one I use. I use the one in template/atlas/aal/ROI_MNI_V4.nii. When I use this one and ft_volumelookup my volume structure (with a mask which I know corresponds to some brain regions), I get 'no_label_found'. When I use the corresponding (?) one from the test script (test/bug2193/aal/ROI_MNI_V4.nii) I get a big (117x1) list with abbreviations, possibly including every single entry from the atlas.

          Furthermore, I've noticed that ft_sourceplot uses ft_prepare_atlas, and not ft_read_atlas. To add to the confusion, it uses atlas_lookup (a private function) to do the actual lookup, and never calls ft_volumelookup. Also, there is an atlas_init, which is apparently never used (although the documentation for atlas_lookup states it should be called prior to atlas_lookup).

          Hi Eelke,

          I can understand your confusion, but see bug 1725. As Robert said, ft_prepare_atlas will get deprecated, and JM has to merge changes into ft_sourceplot and other functions to make this happen.

          I want the test script to stand on its own and not change in the next years, hence I copied the atlas to a test directory.

          Might it be that the problem is in ft_volumelookup? Might it be a difference in mm and cm?

          the spm version on home/common is a mess, so I recommend not to look in those three versions. Better download the proper versions from the respective original places. Otherwise we will be wasting time on changing our code to accommodate the mess of home/common/spm.

          The FT version is fine, w.r.t. the reason for bug 1783, namely an incorrect label name in the *.txt file.  No need to change for that reason.

          sorry, I don't get that. The FT version on home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/template/atlas/aal is about 1.7MB, and the .txt is in format
          FAG	Precentral_L	2001
          FAD	Precentral_R	2002
          ...

          The SPM version in /home/common/matlab/spm8/toolboxes/wfu_pickatlas/MNI_atlas_templates/ is 881k, and the corresponding .txt file is in the format:
          1	Precentral_L
          2	Precentral_R
          ...

          So both versions are obviously different.

          I just downloaded the new version from http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/PickAtlas, and the .nii file is 881k and the .txt format is the same as the SPM version. Hence, I would propose to replace the FT version with the new WFU pickatlas (or current SPM) version of the atlas.

          Any other atlases that might need an update?

WFU copied the original version and modified the txt file to make it consistent with the other atlasses that are included in the WFU PickAtlas toolbox. \n\nThe one we are sharing and that is documented is the one from the original authors, not the modified copy. I consider that we should be sharing and referring to the original one.
