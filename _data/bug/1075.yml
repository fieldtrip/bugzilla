          segmented mri

          hey,

          I've got an error message when I did this:

          load seg01;


          >> cfg = [];
          vol = ft_prepare_singleshell(cfg,seg);

          save vol01 vol;
          not downsampling anatomy
          not downsampling brain

          You can find seg attached.

          Hi Cristiano,

          Could you have a look at this?

          On the other hand, at some point we need to change the documentation to ft_prepare_headmodel, and use ft_prepare_singleshell as a wrapper around this function (put in compat)

          Let's discuss at FT-meeting

          prepare_mesh_segmentation still crashes on line 75 when ft_prepare_singleshell is called as:
          ft_prepare_singleshell([],seg).

          The cause I think is that the cfg.numvertices will be initialized to [], but that the subsref function for the config-object apparently does not properly deal with this, hence a low-level crash.

          What was the consideration to make cfg.numvertices by default empty?

If i run your line of code with Lilla's segmentation everything runs slick. \n\nThe need of an empty numvertices option - if hasdata = false - is commanded by the fact that the inputted surfaces should not be down-upsampled, unless explicitly set by the user. If hasdata is not empty the case is handled in the code (line 94).\n\nLet me know if this is the case with you as well otherwise we ll have to look into it more thoroughly.\nBest\nCristiano"
