        thetext: "(In reply to comment #4)\n\nthanks. It means that you have an eve accompanying your fif. In ft_filetype around line 277 there is\n\n  % known BabySQUID file types, these should go before Neuromag\nelseif filetype_check_extension(filename, '.fif') && exist(fullfile(p, [f '.eve']), 'file')\n  type = 'babysquid_fif';\n  manufacturer = 'Tristan Technologies';\n  content = 'MEG data';\nelseif filetype_check_extension(filename, '.eve') && exist(fullfile(p, [f '.fif']), 'file')\n  type = 'babysquid_eve';\n  manufacturer = 'Tristan Technologies';\n  content = 'MEG data';\n\nwhich is followed by the regular neuromag_fif detection. \n\nThe consequence is that the eve file is read (in ft_read_event around line1087) rather than the continuously sampled trigger channels from the fif file. \n\nI suppose we should change the detection: the presence of an */eve is not enough evidence for it being data from the tristan babysquid system. \n\nI also suppose we should change the event reading: rather than \n1) reading the trigger from the fif file in case of neuromag_fif\n2) reading the *.eve file in case of babysquid_fif\nwe should always combine 1 and 2, i.e. read it from both. Something similar happens for the CTF data format, which also represents \"triggers/events\" in the raw data file and potentially also in an extra marker file and in an extra class file. This requires the two to be merged in the event structure.  \n\nWould you mind sharing your dataset with me for testing purposes?"

          there was a regression 'error' detected by the test script, which was due to unique({event1.type}) returning STI 1 up to 8 plus an additional "Trigger". The extra channel is due to some code that Thomas Hartmann contributed w.r.t. reconstructing full triggers if the bits were shifted by a single or a few samples.

          Note that it was not an actual error. I updated the test script.
