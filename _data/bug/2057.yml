          I just saw your comment at github [1], sorry I was on holiday.

          I know that #!/bin/bash would not work on every system, that's why I
          did not push it to the main repo. But in my SGE setup here at the NIN,
          the script to be executed should be a bash script.

          Minimal example:
          -----begin file "helloworld"-----
          echo hi > ~/hello.txt"
          -----end file "helloworld"-----
          ~$ qsub helloworld
          Your job 2079 ("helloworld") has been submitted

          But then I get an error in the queue (status "r" then becomes "Eqw")

          If I try:
          -----begin file "helloworld"-----
          #!/bin/bash
          echo hi > ~/hello.txt"
          -----end file "helloworld"-----
          ~$ qsub helloworld
          Your job 2080 ("helloworld") has been submitted

          It runs no problem.

          In fact, all the tutorials I have seen on the internet use #!/bin/bash
          Are there other users who use SGE? Don't they need #!/bin/bash or it's
          only a bash thing? I did not know that you could use SGE on DOS.

          Cheers,
          G

          Hi Gio,

          But it is not written to a file. Line 342 in qsubfeval.m shows
            cmdline = sprintf('echo "%s" | qsub -N %s %s -d "%s" -o "%s" -e "%s"', cmdline, jobid, submitoptions, curPwd, curPwd, curPwd);
          so what happens is more like
          echo "echo hi" | qsub
          or
          echo hostname | qsub

          The reason for not making a script is that it saves us one file in the local filesystem, which then also does not have to be cleaned up. The number of files is already very large (input_mat, output_mat, e and o) which makes dirlistings go slow and in some cases problematic (rm *.sh does not work if you have too many files, it then needs xargs). Hence the motivation for keeping the number of files as small as possible.

          If the out-of-the-box version does not work for you, it might be for another reason than what you suspect. Still something to be fixed then.

          Hi Robert,

          Thanks for the reply. You're right that it's not written to file, no
          problems about that, actually it's a very neat solution to use echo
          and pipe.

          But the same problem is still there even if I don't use a script. Here
          is the most minimal example:
          1) echo -e 'echo hi > ~/hello.txt' | qsub
          2) echo -e '#!/bin/bash\necho hi > ~/hello.txt' | qsub
          where 1) doesn't work and 2) does (-e and single quotes are necessary
          to parse the \n in echo)

          There might be some missing configuration options in the SGE setup,
          but I personally understand BASH better than SGE. That's the reason to
          include it in my code (and not push it to the main repo).

          In the nijmegen setup it ends up in a file on the torque server. It might be that the nijmegen default is to use bash, whereas the amsterdam setup uses another default shell. Then having the explicit #! In the file will make a difference. I will check the files on the server.

          Do you know what the default shell is at the NIN?

          You're right! The default shell for me as user is bash, but all the
          queues on the SGE are configured to use /bin/sh. I found out by "qconf
          -mq QUEUE_NAME" (see [1]). I didn't know this. I will see if I can
          change the defaults (it depends on my colleagues, I don't know which
          shell they prefer), otherwise I'll keep the #!/bin/bash in my own
          repo.

          Thanks for helping me out on this. Let me know if you need more
          information from me. For the rest, the SGE with Fieldtrip works great!
          I'm very happy with the current setup. The only other change I made at
          [2] was because I'm the only user (and I can keep track of memory
          usage) and I don't like when SGE kills my job because of memory
          limits.

          Thanks!
