        thetext: I guess it would be best if fieldtrip-bugs *only* receives a notification email when a new bug has just been submitted. This means that the whine mails should also not be sent to fieldtrip-bugs.

        thetext: Although I can edit the whine settings (administration -> whining), no whining events are listed in my screen. Maybe someone else (Robert?) did create the whine, and can change it?

        thetext: "I believe the \"you have new bugs\" email is not a whining email in the sense of the bugzilla preferences. \n\nShould we just change the status for bugs that have not yet been assigned to anyone in specific to ASSIGNED (i.e. to the general user). That will stop these emails. Upon assigning them to a proper person, the status can be changed back to NEW."
