          bug data

          Run attached code on attached data (5 trials worth, variable length) and note that cfg.output = 'fourier' does not work due to assignment mismatch issues. Data is not getting padded correctly (or something) if you inspect the assignment 'fourierspctrm(currrptind,:,:,:) = spectrum;' in the debugger. Same result for both mtmconvol and wavelet methods.

          The code works fine with cfg.output = 'pow', so it is probably something wrong with the fftflag or keeprpt = 4 code branches in ft_freqanalysis.

        thetext: I should also note that cfg.output = 'fourier' works fine with method mtmfft (since the trials are averaged over), so it is specifically the time-frequency methods that return fourier spectra are broken for variable-length trials.

Indeed , the current ft_freqanalysis doesn't deal with different trial length very well. This problem can be solved if  we initialize the fourierspctrm  with  max trial length . Accordingly , we need to  change  ft_freqanalysis(cfg, data) at \n line 533;   ntoi = numel(toi) --> \n             ntoi = max(trllength); \n \nthen update the spectrm matrix with different trial length\n\n line 702   \n spectrum = permute(reshape(spectrum_mtmconvol,[nchan ntoi ntaper(1) nfoi]),[3 1 4 2]); --> \n spectrum = permute(reshape(spectrum_mtmconvol,[nchan trllength(itrial) ntaper(1) nfoi]),[3 1 4 2]);\n\n line 713   \n  fourierspctrm(currrptind,:,:,:) = spectrum;   -->    \n  fourierspctrm(currrptind,:,:,1:trllength(itrial)) = spectrum;\n\nThis will influence output 'pow ' as well, so we have to adapt :\n\nline 606  spectrum = reshape(permute(spectrum_mtmconvol(:,:,freqtapind{ifoi}),[3 1 2]),[ntaper(ifoi) nchan 1 ntoi]); --> \nspectrum = reshape(permute(spectrum_mtmconvol(:,:,freqtapind{ifoi}),[3 1 2]),[ntaper(ifoi) nchan 1 trllength(itrial)]);\n   @ Robert: I don't know debug the bug on the bug on our meta since I don't have edit right.  At  this moment , I do it on my desktop, which is kind of inconvenient . Coud you please point me the common way to do it in DCCN ? Thanks in advance."

          I had forgotten that cfg.toi = 'all' was unsupported -- I found it by looking through the source. Is the preferred calling convention for these methods then to find the longest trial and set cfg.toi accordingly to do the analysis on all timepoints? e.g.,

          maxlen = max(cellfun(@length, data.time));
          cfg.toi = data.time{cellfun(@length, data.time) == maxlen};

          I can confirm that this works on my actual data, but it does seem like it would be easier to make a cfg.toi = 'all' option, to save user the trouble of having to do this (and maybe make it default, to match the default maxperlen padding).

          Thanks Robert and Haiteng for working on this!

          looking into this a bit more I noticed that:

          -ft_specest_mtmconvol supports 'all' as a timeoi specification
          -the issue occurs when requesting 'fourier' in the output because it runs a different chunk of code in ft_freqanalysis. When asking for cfg.output = 'pow' with cfg.keeptrials results in some extra checking in ft_freqanalysis.
