          As of April 12, it seems.

          Also note the weird dashes (no pun intended) on the dashboard page: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dashboard some of them are no longer minus signs (-) but en-dashes (—). Related?

          the dashes are due to a double short-dash -- being rendered as a single long-dash. It has been like this forever, so is not related.

          I suspect it being due to my central storage quotum being full (last week), causing write problems. I cleaned up, there is again space but apparently the test suite still does not run properly.

          I am trying to do it manually: one problem seems to be

          Finding old checkouts to remove...
          Removing ...
          Getting latest revision...
          svn: Working copy '.' locked
          svn: run 'svn cleanup' to remove locks (type 'svn help cleanup' for details)


          I ran svn cleanup, see whether that helps...
