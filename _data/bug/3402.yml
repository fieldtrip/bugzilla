          I thought this had already been discussed here (maybe in relation to another SPM MEX file): the MEX files have to be recompiled in order to run on Mac with recent MATLAB versions. You can find a more recent xlm_findstr.mexmaci62 here:
          https://github.com/spm/spm12/blob/master/%40xmltree/private/xml_findstr.mexmaci64
          Using the standalone gifti library works because it doesn't use the MEX file in order to make distribution easier - it will be slower though.

          this is indeed a duplicate of 3365. However, a solution has not been found yet. Let's keep the discussion there.

          Thanks for confirming and the recompiled mexfile, Guillaume.

        thetext: The mex file works well in matlab 2017b, Guillaume. Did you by any chance test whether it's also compatible with older version of matlab? If so, I can replace the current version of the mex file by it. We try to be backward-compatible up to 2012.

          With SPM, we aim SPM12 to be compatible with all MATLAB versions starting at R2007a:
          https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/MATLAB
          I could run the new compiled MEX file with R2010a without problem so this should solve the issue for you.

        thetext: This table is great. I was going to ask whether it also applies to the gifti suite, until I found out it's already embedded in SPM12 (there is a separate gifti folder in fieldtrip/external).
