          This is something we considered in the past, but that somehow never happened. For coordsys we have a determine and a convert function. Right now I think it would better to mirror this for unit as well.

          A second aspect to be fixed is that the function is called ft_convert_units with an "s" at the end, whereas the field in the geometrical object is called unit without an "s" at the end. So I think it should become ft_determine_unit and ft_convert_unit.

          @Thijs: agreed or are there aspects I am overlooking right now?

          hmm, I just now notice that there is a ft_estimate_units function involved as well.


          mac001> find . -name ft_convert_units.m
          ./fileio/private/ft_convert_units.m
          ./forward/ft_convert_units.m
          ./plotting/private/ft_convert_units.m

          mac001> find . -name ft_estimate_units.m
          ./fileio/private/ft_estimate_units.m
          ./forward/ft_estimate_units.m
          ./plotting/private/ft_estimate_units.m

          With grep it seems that ft_estimate_units is only being called by ft_convert_units and that therefore the estimate_units can become a subfunction instead.

          (In reply to comment #1)

          It's probably not as simple as renaming ft_estimate_units into ft_determine_unit?

          (In reply to comment #0)

          I agree. Does the function also deal with units that are not length/distance related?
