          warning('Emulating undocumented behaviour (w=[]). Please use w=0 instead.');

          This is OK when the user is calling the nanvar, but ttest() also uses nanvar with w=[]. Therefore, each ttest() generates this warning.

          2 possible solutions:
          - Replace warning() with warning_once().
          - Remove the warning, and just implement the behaviour with w=[] as the stats toolbox and don't care that it's undocumented.

        thetext: "My view:\nw=0 is the default value, therefor an empty w should always revert to w=0. \n\nI would vote for removing the warning. Perhaps we can make a note about this in the function header/help.\n\nUnless someone can convince me of a difference in meaning between nanvar(x) and nanvar(x,[])."
