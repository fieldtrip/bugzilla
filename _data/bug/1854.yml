          it can simply be reproduced with

          >>ft_plot_mesh([1 2 3], 'vertexcolor', 'r')
          Error using set
          Value must be numeric

          Error in ft_plot_mesh (line 170)
            set(hs, 'FaceVertexCData', vertexcolor, 'FaceColor', 'interp');

          This is supposed to work.
