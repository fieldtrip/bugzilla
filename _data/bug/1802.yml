          I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but I was wondering if I could get help with an error message I've been getting. I'm going through the tutorial on "Source reconstruction of event-related fields using minimum-norm estimate" with the tutorial data, and when I enter the command "ft_volumewrite(cfg, seg);" MATLAB gives me the following error message:


          ??? Index exceeds matrix dimensions.

          Error in ==> ft_volumewrite at 124
            cfg.parameter = cfg.parameter{1};


          Do you know if I have done something wrong in the tutorial? I've attached a .mat file of my workspace up until that point. Please let me know if there's anything else I should send.

          Thanks very much.

          Hi Andrew,

          thanks for the report. I can imagine it being related to some recent changes to the segmentation datatype (see "help ft_datatype_segmentation").

          Could you attach the mat file with the workspace to this bug report? Or if it is too large, please share it through one of the methods listed at the bottom of http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/bugzilla

          Hi Andrew,

          thanks a lot for your message. The problem occurred during the call to ft_volumesegment, because the anatomy field got deleted from the output segmentation structure. I fixed this now. If you create the seg structure again with ft_volumesegment, and then run ft_volumewrite, it should work fine.

          The FieldTrip version with the updated function should be available for download in 24 hours (as latest).

          Please, let me know if you experience further problems.

          Best,
          Lilla

          I copied the file to /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/test/bug1802
