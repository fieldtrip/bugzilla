          ft_sourceplot method surface has these cool options. But documentation is not very clear. Would be great if could be made clearer in help and or on wiki

          %   cfg.surffile       = string, file that contains the surface (default = 'single_subj_T1.mat')
          %                        'single_subj_T1.mat' contains a triangulation that corresponds with the
          %                         SPM anatomical template in MNI coordinates
          %   cfg.surfinflated   = string, file that contains the inflated surface (default = [])
          %   cfg.surfdownsample = number (default = 1, i.e. no downsampling)
          %   cfg.projmethod     = projection method, how functional volume data is projected onto surface
          %                        'nearest', 'project', 'sphere_avg', 'sphere_weighteddistance'
          %   cfg.projvec        = vector (in mm) to allow different projections that
          %                        are combined with the method specified in cfg.projcomb
          %   cfg.projcomb       = 'mean', 'max', method to combine the different projections
          %   cfg.projweight     = vector of weights for the different projections (default = 1)
          %   cfg.projthresh     = implements thresholding on the surface level
          %   (cfg.projthresh    = 0.7 means 70% of maximum)
          %   cfg.sphereradius   = maximum distance from each voxel to the surface to be
          %                        included in the sphere projection methods, expressed in mm
          %   cfg.distmat        = precomputed distance matrix (default = [])
          %   cfg.camlight       = 'yes' or 'no' (default = 'yes')
          %   cfg.renderer       = 'painters', 'zbuffer',' opengl' or 'none' (default = 'opengl')
          %                        note that when using opacity the OpenGL renderer is required.

        thetext: Most of this part of the code has been contributed by Markus Siegel (surffile etc) and Joachim Gross (projection stuff). I think that if you read through the code you can figure out most of it. This will probably be most efficient in boosting the quality of the documentation. Could you give it a try yourself. Do you still have svn-rights?

          HI JM,

          yes I still have SVN rights, but am transitioning jobs so have no time my self for this. I just noticed it when I used it that documentation could be improved, so I thought I'll file it :)

          Cheers,
          Ingrid
