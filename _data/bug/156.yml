        thetext: This actually goes back to an email exchange from May, where I noted that the Matlab functions or MEX file for reading/writing events does not convert the 0-based indices from the protocol to the 1-based indices of Matlab and vice versa. I already made the changes in the source files, and recompiled MEX files for Windows (32bit) and Linux (32/64), but MEX files for the Mac still need to be compiled.
