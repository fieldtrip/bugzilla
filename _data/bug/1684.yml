        thetext: "getting more documentation and tutorials, I think it makes sense to rename it to SubjectEEG.zip, to have it more in line with the others. Or perhaps another name (more related to the task used in that data). \n\nIt also has to be renamed on the wiki.\n\nIn case relevant info is missing on that data, ask Irina."

          I need to gain access for the ftp server in order to doing so.
          Alternatively, you can rename the file on the ftp and I will change the documentation accordingly

        thetext: The ftp server is automatically synched every day from /home/common/matlab/fieldtrip/data/ftp. If you can change it there, then in the evening the renamed version will appear on the ftp.

          okidoki, done. Note for any others: renaming is not possible using the dektop PC, only by sshing to a mentat and doing it there works. Surprisingly, the file disappeared after renaming on my windows machine...

          right now, I only changed the name of the zip, not changed the content, i.e. the filenames are still subj2.vhdr etc.

          btw: only occurance on the wiki:
