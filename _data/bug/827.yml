        thetext: "The thing is that now with ft_topoplotTFR it is unclear what the xlim and ylim  parameters will stand for. It changes according to the dimensions of the input data and I doubt it is intuitively consistent, suspecting a bug. At least I have made several mistakes after e.g. having used ft_selectdata to average over time or frequency. \n\ne.g. while the dimord is 'chan_freq':\n\na) specifying NO xlim and NO ylim, relying on the defaults ('all'), gives a correct plot over all frequencies.\n\nb) specifying NO xlim (chan?), but a valid ylim (freq?), always gives a plot using ALL frequencies.\n\nc) specifying NO ylim (chan?), but xlim as frequency give a correct plot\n\nDebugging in topoplotER shows that indeed xlim is taken as the frequency dimension, while ylim is empty. \n\nSoooo... should xlim not be channel and ylim frequency?"

          this was considered by Roemer et al and discussed in more detail at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/restructure_and_rework_all_visualization_functions.

          Right now there are no plans to do a major rewrite of the plotting functions, hence I will close this bug.
