          -inventorise which trials in the pipeline of an analysis can pass on the trialinfo field, if present in the input-data. in general this boils down to those data structures containing single trial information, so 'raw' 'comp' or other data containing a 'rpt' in the dimord
          -samplinfo can only be passed on in time domain data 'raw' or 'comp' in the absence of downsampling
