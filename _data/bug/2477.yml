          Hey fieldtrip team,

          I believe I found a bug in ft_connectivity_psi.m. The output variable p seems to be an intermediate step in the calculation of the connectivity measure (variable c). Thus, the connectivity output as far as I can tell (without understanding all of the code) should be incorrect.
          Best,

          Björn

          Hi Björn,
          As far as I can tell the implementation is correct.
          The variable called 'c' is the cross-spectral density matrix.
          In line 92, the c is normalized with sqrt(p1.*p2) yielding the complex-valued coherency. This serves as an input to the phaseslope function that is implemented in exactly the same way as described by Guido Nolte.
          Please let me know if you disagree.

          JM

          Hi Bjorn,
          do you still have objections against the code?

        thetext: Indeed the code was incorrect. However the mix-up in variables has so far been probably inconsequential, because the code will be called with a single 'repetition' (i.e. the average across trials) by default from ft_connectivityanalysis.
