          Both the OBJ and the PLY file were slightly different from the ones we had seen before, but adding support for both of then was not too hard.

          I made some code updates and merged them in the release version at https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/739

          Please download the latest version and http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/electrode should work for you.

          Note that the PLY loads much faster than the OBJ, since its internal structure is much easier.
