        thetext: "Floris wrote:\n\nI just reran a script which I use to plot TFRs of ICA components and I discovered with help of Mathilde Bonnefond that there is an inconvenience in the ft_freqanalysis function since it changed on the 12th of June 2014. \n\nThis implies that if you run ft_componentanalysis before ft_freqanalysis on preprocessed data, there are both 'raw' and 'comp' features detected by ft_freqanalysis, leading to the function defining the input as 'raw+comp' and expecting a dimord field in the data structure, which is not supplied by default.\n\nThere is a workaround, one may delete the 'topo' and 'topolabel' fields from the input data, ft_freqanalysis works normally again.\n\nYou may already be aware of this, but I thought it may be good to let you know."

          I fixed it

          mac011> svn commit ft_freqanalysis.m test/
          Sending        ft_freqanalysis.m
          Adding         test/test_bug2613.m
          Transmitting file data ..
          Committed revision 9636.

          The fix consists of changing from ft_selectdata_old to the new/newer/newest implementation.

          @Floris: Note however that your cfg is incorrect. The cfg.trials field refers to trials  up to trial number 2409, whereas there are only 182 trials in the data structure.

          sorry, typo: 2409 should read 240
