        thetext: We recorded and live broadcasted all material on youtube, where it is now available for the whole world. The streaming was done using an "epiphan lecture recorder x2", which also recorded it on a local disk (and later copied to the fileserver). I should get that original material from the epiphan and store it somewhere safe.
