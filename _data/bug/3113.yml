          *A user had a very specific need, to segment torso structures (interesting topic). We managed to load the dicom images into FT but somehow the slices were not parallel to xyz (even after volume reslice to isometric voxels).

        thetext: without access to data that demonstrates the skewed/sheared voxel alignment, I cannot resolve this.
