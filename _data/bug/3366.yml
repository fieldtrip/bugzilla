          This bugzilla page is for discussion of the new feature. The actual code (and possibly the more detailled discussion of that code) is managed on our github page at http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/git

          Can you please confirm that you can access http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip? If so, I propose you read through the tutorial at http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/git

        thetext: "re-referencing is now implemented in ft_preprocessing for the high-level interface that is explained at http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/preprocessing_erp. The high-level interface helps with data management (channel selection etc).\n\nThe low-level code works as follows\nft_preprocessing.m calls private/preproc.m, which in turn calls preproc/ft_preproc_rereference.m \nIn the last function we now have methods 'avg' and 'median'. Furthermore, the function gets a list of channels that is to be considered for the reference. \n\nPlease have a look at ft_preproc_rereference. We may extend that function with the method 'rest'. \n\nSince this function is often called many times (for each trial or data segment), I suspect that the computational overhead might be too large. The alternative that I therefore see is that we implement the REST reference as a \"montage\". This is a structure that, together with the data, is handled by ft_preprocessing as cfg.montage.\n\nIn this case, the low-level code works as follows\nft_preprocessing.m calls private/preproc.m, which in turn calls forward/ft_apply_montage.m \n\nTo understand the montage, please check ft_apply_montage. It is basically a matrix multiplication (newdat = montage.tra * olddat) with the bookkeeping of the channels (rows and columns)."

        thetext: "I have a look at ft_preproc_rereference. We may extend that function with the method 'rest' first. One input of the method 'rest' is leadfield matrix. Therefore, I suggest to calculate leadfield matrix using FieldTrip first (especially using real head modal); i.e., to add an input of leadfield matrix G, instead of calculating leadfield matrix in modified ft_preproc_rereference.m. \n\nMaybe we can add an input of leadfield in function ft_preprocessing.m (such as cfg.G, channels X sources), if user want to re-refer to REST.\n\nI will work on this function first, and test it next step."
