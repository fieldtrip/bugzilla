        thetext: "When creating neighbour templates, I included templates based on all 2D layouts as well. However, these neighbour definitions are not generalizable to real 3D gradiometer data. E.g. for the neuromag306 system, we now got several templates based on the 2D templates:\nneuromag306mag_neighb\nneuromag306grad_neighb\nneuromag306planar_neighb\nAnd one based on the test data (3D gradiometer information)\nneuromag306_neighb\n\n\nIt might be confusing for some people that there are different templates for the same system. Also the question whether it makes sense at all to support 'wrong' neighbour templates can be asked \n\n\nAny thoughts on this?"

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

        thetext: I don't know, this has to do MArco Buiatti's recent mails in the mailing list. You could read up on them and decide then? I am not sure, especially because we do not work with neuromag data here at the DCCN. Robert might know more about this, best would be to ask and discuss with him.

        thetext: added crossreference to bug800 - I'm gonna check the 2D templates after having proper neighbour templates and decide upon the quality of the neighbour templates on 3D sensor positions whether the 2D templates are useful or not. In any case, I'll also work on this bug as decided (e.g. throw a warning)

          - thus also created http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/why_are_there_multiple_neighbour_templates_for_the_neuromag306_system

          Note that the neuromag306_neighb.mat is the concatenation of the magnetometer and the gradiometer definition, i.e. magnetormeters and gradiometers are still separated, but all sensors are in one file now.

          I fixed the neuromag306 neighbour issue and then realized you were not in the CC list. Please check the last comment (==fix) in this bug
