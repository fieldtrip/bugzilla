      thetext: "Version 20150115\n\nDuring execution of ft_interpolatenan with an artifact matrix that had artifacts at the end sample point of trial, the sample_window resulted in an error \"Exceeded Matrix dimensions\".\n\nUpon inspection, it was found that [dum, idx_end_c] = find(diff(replace,[],2)==-1) failed to capture the end point of the sample with this code.\n\nMy matrix had a size 46080 samples. At a point of time, during debugging I found this as the cause of the error:\n\nidx_start_c = \n45223\n45223\n45223\n45223\n45270\n45270\n45270\n45270\n46050\n46050\n46050\n46050\n\nidx_end_c = \n45250\n45250\n45250\n45250\n45394\n45394\n45394\n45394\n\nNotice that the idx_end_c failed to capture 46080 (the artifact was at the very end of the trial as well). \n\nPlease let me know if I made a mistake in interpreting this error. Thanks."
