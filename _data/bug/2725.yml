        thetext: "We currently have a nice set of tutorials specifically made for the NatMeg workshop in Stockholm. Some adjustments need to be made in order for them to be put next to the other tutorials on the wiki. \n\nThings to be done:\n-Move images from natmeg_temp to natmeg\n*Requires read&write rights to tutorial/natmeg\n-Collect data for tutorial and put on FTP\n-Slightly rewrite introduction of some tutorials keeping in mind that viewers did not follow the tutorials in the same sequence as the natmeg attendees."

          FYI: I have started on converting the tutorials into test scripts, and cleaning them up (on the wiki and on the ftp). I will commit the test scripts soon.

          @Jim, could you disable the BTsync upload procedure?

        thetext: "looking at the tutorials, it seems to me that only the\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/natmeg/beamforming\nis relying on data from the preprocessing tutorial for the data, and to the dipolefitting tutorial for the head models and aligned mri.\n\nThat means that the tutorials have to be updated such that only these files which are explicitly loaded are also saved. All other \"save\" commands (and \"print -dpng\" commands) should be removed from the tutorials. \n\n@Jim and @Stephen: am I right here?\n\nWe can leave the intermediate steps in the respective natmeg/xxx subdirectories as backup material, but we don't have to refer to it on the wiki. During the actual hands-on session, people were messing up all files anyway, by saving their intermediate results, overwriting our backup material."
