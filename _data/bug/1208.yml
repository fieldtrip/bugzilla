          Hello,

          I was considering buffering data to a MySQL database using the
          ft_write_data and ft_read_date mysql interfaces.

          However, the files db_connect.m, db_insert.m, db_insert_blob.m, etc..
          are all missing.

          Does anyone know where I might be able to download these?

          Thanks very much

I looked into this: compiling the mex file requires client libraries for mysql to be present. That is a lot of work (especially given all 6 platforms we actively support), so instead of including the compiled mex file for all platforms in the fieldtrip release, I will just point to the place where the mex file and/or source code can be obtained (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8663-mysql-database-connector).\n\nWhat I have just done is to extend ft_hastoolbox with mysql (detect the mex file, point to URL if not present). Furthermore, I have added a call to the ft_read and and write functions to check the presence of the mysql toolbox.\n\ndhcp158> grep -l db_ *.m\nft_read_data.m\nft_read_event.m\nft_read_header.m\nft_write_data.m\nft_write_event.m\n\ndhcp158> svn commit `grep -l db_ *.m` ../utilities/ft_hastoolbox.m \nSending        fileio/ft_read_data.m\nSending        fileio/ft_read_event.m\nSending        fileio/ft_read_header.m\nSending        fileio/ft_write_data.m\nSending        fileio/ft_write_event.m\nSending        utilities/ft_hastoolbox.m\nTransmitting file data ......\nCommitted revision 5260."

          I cleaned up my bugzilla list by changing the status from resolved (either fixed or wontfix) into closed. If you don't agree, please reopen the bug.
