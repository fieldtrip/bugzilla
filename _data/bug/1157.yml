          Hi,

          File fileio/README reads:

                 The following files were downloaded from http://www.koders.com
                   base64.c
                   base64.h

          I cannot find these files anywhere. Have they been removed? Has the source code been integrated elsewhere? For what it's worth I've found Matlab files that could have replaced that C code:
                 external/gifti/@gifti/private/base64decode.m
                 external/gifti/@gifti/private/base64encode.m

          Please fix the README.

          Regards,

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

          Robert reported a more general problem of outdated references (wiki, READMEs) to the code in the mex files.
