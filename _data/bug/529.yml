          If in-memory data has a continuous structure (i.e., the begin sample of trial N exactly follows the end sample of trial N-1), filter padding should in principle be possible for preprocessing of in-memory data.

          (Some notes:
           - If padding is specified, and the in-memory data is largely continuous, but misses some segments (trials), ft_preprocessing could (a) throw an error, or (b) only filter the trials for which padding is possible. Preferably, this should be made a configurable option.)

          This is hardly possible to realize:

          - if individual trials have been demeaned or otherwise processed, then even if 'continuous' in time, there is a discontinuity at the boundary. This is hard to robustly check.
          - judging continuity is hard to check from the sampleinfo field, because sometimes this one is constructed on the fly, suggesting continuity, which may not be true.
