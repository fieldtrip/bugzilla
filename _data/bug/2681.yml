        thetext: I implemented this in revision 8535. It has not been working for some time now. I tried to figure out which commit broke it, but this turns out to be quite difficult. If anyone suspects a commit of theirs might be the reason for this breaking, perhaps they could fix it? Merci! :)

          It seems one of Jörn's most recent commits on the databrowser fixed the issue. For me, the data cursor works again (mentat matlab 2012a).

          Danke schön!

          you're welcome!
          but one of my most recent commits must have been a while ago already ;)
