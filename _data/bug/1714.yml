          Jan-Mathijs reported last week that he fixed a bug in test_ft_plot_vector, but that the Dashboard still shows a failing test.

          I dug into the problem, and when I schedule a test manually using the exact same scripts, it shows that the test passes, but when the test is scheduled on Torque, it fails with an unclear error:

        thetext: Indeed it was a path issue; the test all were run with my manually updated SVN version on the path :/.  Now the issue is resolved with a 'restoredefaultpath', and indeed ft_plot_vector is passing as it should.
