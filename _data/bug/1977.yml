          Hi Robert,

          I'll write in English in case you want to forward this to people. I noticed that:
          1) cfg.maskparameter is not documented anymore, apparently an depreciated option?
          2) NaNs are taken out of the data now before calling ft_plot_topo

          The thing is, I'd like to mask out the channels with Nans, because there is no data there, I also don't want it interpolated from the neighbours. But now I can't since the channels are taken out of the data, so I get an error when interpolating the mask parameter line 189 in ft_plot_topo (line 189):
          maskimagetmp = griddata(chanX', chanY, datmask, xi', yi, interpmethod);

          I'm trying to solve this, but its tricky. I've started by building in an option to not remove the NaNs in ft_topoplotTFR. So I still have the chans with NaNs in ft_plot_topo. But subsequently it has to be dealt with there, since otherwise my Zi is all Nans after line 200: [Xi,Yi,Zi] = griddata(chanX', chanY, dat, xi', yi, interpmethod);

          It looks like you don't want to deal with NaNs in ft_plot_topo since you have the following warning:
          % check for nans in the data, these should be dealt with by the caller
          if any(isnan(dat))
           warning('the data passed to ft_plot_topo contains NaNs, the interpolation will have unexpected results. NaNs should be dealt with by the caller function.');
          end

          Would be great if we can get the code working again to allow masking channels. Are you OK with dealing with NaNs in ft_plot_topo? -> when interpmethod is v4 and NaNs are in the data, to take out the NaNs channels in the data after making the mask based on the channels including the NaN ones?

          Cheers,
          Ingrid

          I am not aware of it being deprecated. Also, these still document it:

          roboos@mentat001> grep -l ^%.*maskparameter *plot*.m
          ft_multiplotER.m
          ft_multiplotTFR.m
          ft_singleplotER.m
          ft_singleplotTFR.m
          ft_sourceplot.m

          The remainder of your email suggests that it is missing from the topoplot documentation (which it is indeed).

          TODO -> document it in ft_topoplotER and ft_topoplotTFR

At the moment you cannot mask channels containing nans. as they are removed before we get to the masking, and removing them results in them getting interpolated."

          Aha, the problem was that in to code where the NaN-channels are taken out of the data, they are not taken out of the data mask. So if you'd mask and you had nan in the data, you'd always get an error, since the maskdatavector was too long. I've fixed that, because that was just a bug.

          Then there's still the case of not wanting to remove the nans and masking away those channels. I'll now implement cfg.interpolatenan as proposed in ft_topoplotTFR, and document the cfg.maskparameter in both topoplotTFR and topoplotER.

          Then in ft_plot_topo, the nans have to be removed in the data (but not the mask) before interpolating, to prevent the interpolation to fail. I'll also implement that.

          Sure: you can have a look at the dashboard to have a look in which part they failed:

          I don't know what happened, but the implementation of cfg.interpolatenan = yes/no is gone. Maybe someone took it out because of the errors (see comment 8)? Does anyone know? I still like this option. What was the problem with it? I don't have all the test data, so running the test scripts from here is not as easy as it seems for me. I'm not very familiar with this testing procedure. I'll built it in again in my own version and test it more thoroughly. If it passes I'll commit in a few days. Would be great if someone could let me know what happened.

          Thanks,
