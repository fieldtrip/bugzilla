        thetext: "It seems that you recently start using Matlab R2014b and ask for possible remaining bugs due to the new graphics. I just noticed one using the ft_artifact_zvalue when the cfg.artfctdef.zvalue.interactive is turn on ('yes'). Indeed, when I want to use the command buttons (such as go through the next trial or the next artifact) inside the GUI, I have the following error:\n\nNo appropriate method, property, or field Key for class matlab.ui.eventdata.ActionData.\n\nError in ft_artifact_zvalue>parseKeyboardEvent (line 1074)\nkey = eventdata.Key;\n\nError in ft_artifact_zvalue>keyboard_cb (line 675)\n  key = parseKeyboardEvent(eventdata);\n \nError using waitfor\nError while evaluating UIControl Callback\n\nI don't have any other problems with the other GUIs. I hope it will help you to find the source of the bug."

          while preprocessing my EEG data I encountered a bug with the keyboard-keys in the interactive mode of ft_artifact_zvalue.m. Essentially, the GUI could only be controlled by clicking with the mouse, not with the keyboard shortcuts. This has been reported before at http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2856. I looked into it and changed a few lines of code. The attached version has fully functional mouse- and keyboard control. Unfortunately, I could only test it on Matlab 2015a in Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8.1, not in earlier versions. Nevertheless, everything seems to work fine and maybe it's of help to you and other Fieldtrip users.

          Changes to the most up-to-date version are:

          lines 47-60: Added keymappings to help
          lines 441+442: changed 'h=figure;' to 'h=figure('KeyPressFcn', @keyboard_cb); '
          lines 688-705: Convert the keymappings so switch can use them.

          In addition I had to change some of the mappings because key combinations (i.e. shift+x, ctrl+x etc.) did not work.
          You can find these changes in lines 492-510 and 710-748.

          The also attached html is a result of visdiff() in Matlab and highlights the mentioned changes.

        thetext: "(In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #1)\n\nHi Wanja,\n\nThanks for the suggested fix. I have incorporated it in the code. \n\nIt would be good to further investigate how to get the modifier keys to work (like ctrl and shift) in combination with the arrows, as that is more natural. Hence I will leave it open. \n\nBut for now it works better than it used to do.\n\nsvn cmac011> svn commit \nSending        ft_artifact_zvalue.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 10437."
