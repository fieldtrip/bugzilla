          Hello,

          When I run sphericalSplineInterpolate.m on my data it gets stuck on line 55 at: "iC = pinv(C);".

          Thanks
          Yoel

          Thanks.

          I had attached the data sample and the script.

          You can run it with :

          fixelec(z1,interpolate_at_z,electrodes_names_to_keep)

          Thanks

          Hi, thanks again. Yes, you are right with how to call the function.

          The elec_1020select function is taken from cftimport1.03 plugin.(Somehow I had assumed that you have it already, it exists ,for example in EEGLAB). Anyway I had attached it again.

          Thanks

        thetext: hm, for me your script works perfectly fine, both on a windows 32bit as on a linudx 64bit machine (both tested with Matlab2009b). could you let me know what OS and what matlab version you are using?

          Well, for me it started working again. I believe the reason might be because I used win8 pre-release version and only now Microsoft updated something with the final release.

          Many thanks for your time, and sorry for the bothering.
