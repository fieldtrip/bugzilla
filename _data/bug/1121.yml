          It goes wrong in prepare_mesh_segmentation_new (among others).

          -The subfunction triangulate assumes the input 'seg' to be boolean, which is not the case with me.

          -Also, it does a triangulation of 3 compartments ('gray', 'white', 'csf') and then crashes, because it is apparently not supposed to have three compartments when creating the single shell.
