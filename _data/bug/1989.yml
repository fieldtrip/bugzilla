        thetext: "I was contacted by the author of CalcMD5, who pointed out that the BSD license clause to his function was not fulfilled. I have moved his function to external/misc and added the appropriate license. I expect that there are other functions in private directories that also suffer from license or copyright incompatibilities or errors.\n\nTODO: \n - search through all fieldtrip private directories for functions that originate from elsewhere (a.o. the arrowheads and uimagesg functions come to mind)\n - move them to fieldtrip/external/misc and add a copying (and optionally a readme) file  \n\nNow that I think of it, some that predate the external directory alltogether are mentioned in fieldtrip/README\n\nThe following files were downloaded from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange\n  uimage.m\n  uimagesc.m\n  arrow.m\n  keep.m\n\nTODO:\n - update the fieldtrip/README file and remove the exceptions"

        thetext: "I've been getting a warning from uimage that would be easy to fix, but I realized it's an external function, so I have a couple questions:\n\n1) I found this old bug about licenses and noticed that the uimage license is still missing, so I reopened it.  I could copy the license from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11368-uimage-uimagesc/all_files but then should I also copy the latest versions of the other files?  The changes appear negligible:  white space, semicolons, and comments only.\n\n2) The latest version won't eliminate the warning I'm seeing, so I'm wondering if it's okay to fix, given this isn't a FieldTrip function.  As far as I can tell, the license file doesn't seem to say anything about editing the code.  It's not causing a problem yet (aside from annoying my perfectionistic tendencies), but looks like it may someday:\n\nWarning: NARGCHK will be removed in a future release. Use NARGINCHK or NARGOUTCHK instead. \n> In uimage (line 49)\n  In uimagesc (line 28)\n  In ft_plot_matrix (line 251)\n  In ft_singleplotTFR (line 466) \nWarning: NARGCHK will be removed in a future release. Use NARGINCHK or NARGOUTCHK instead. \n> In uimage (line 49)\n  In uimagesc (line 47)\n  In ft_plot_matrix (line 254)\n  In ft_singleplotTFR (line 466) \n\nThe offending line, \"error(nargchk(3,inf,nargin));\" can be replaced by \"narginchk(3,inf);\""
