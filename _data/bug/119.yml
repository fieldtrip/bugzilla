        thetext: "see email Vladimir, 19 July 2010 14:14:36 GMT+02:00\n\nthere was recently renaming of all the plotting functions without any updating of \nthe code calling those functions. This had very detrimental effects to say the \nleast on SPM functionality as we were just about to make a public update. I\nmade some fixes for the things that weren't working, not sure it I\nfixed everything. Please try not to do this again i.e. function\nrenaming and code updating should go hand-in-hand."

          I have changed the function calls to ft_plot_xxx in fieldtrip main and committed revision 1430.

          furthermore, I have changed the function calls to ft_plot_xxx in fieldtrip/private, and the function calls to ft_select_xxx in revision 1431.

          @Cristiano, it is up to you to test everything and to ensure that there are no other dependencies to plotting/compat. Fieldtrip itself should never use a compat function!

          I changed function names, help references and any occurences in the text to 'plot*' or 'select*' functions. This was done by means of a find/replace search on each file of the words 'plot' and 'select'. A thorogh testing has been run with a custom version of depfun, which checks the dependencies of each plotting function, and checks if any of the old name convention routines is called.
          Since this does not happen, I am confident that the problem is fixed and tested.
