          each of these directories should contain a test dataset in the original format.

          there should also be a dicom directory.

          there should be a test_read_mri script which reads the MRI from each format

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
