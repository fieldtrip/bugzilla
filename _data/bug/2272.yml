          I am trying to use ft_read_header to load .cnt files, but consistently have an error. I updated fieldtrip to the 9/3/13 version, and am still having the problem. On the command line:

          >>cfg = [];
          >>cfg.hdr = ft_read_header('101.cnt')
          ??? Error using ==> read_eep_cnt
          Too many input arguments.

          Error in ==> ft_read_header at 661
              hdr = read_eep_cnt(filename, 1, 1);

          I've tried other variants like:

          cfg.header = ft_read_header('101.cnt')

          cfg.datafile = '101.cnt';
          cfg.header = ft_read_header(cfg)

          Thanks,
          Dan

          Hi Dan,

          imho this is a problem with 64bit matlab on windows. Could you let us know what Os you are using and what Matlab version (and whether 32bit or 64bit)? I can check then again how I dealt with this (cause I also have cnt files and managed to read them in)

          mexed read_eep_cnt file for win64

          Hi Dan,

          could you check whether using the attached file works for you? It should go to FieldTrip\trunk\external\eeprobe, where also all other read_eep_cnt files are located

          I copied the file into the eeprobe folder, and it now sits next to read_eep_cnt.mexw32. I am still having the error. Is there something I need to do with the read_eep_cnt.mexw64 file?

          I did not know the .m was a fallback file. My "which" points to the .m file. In fact, it was always doing this (it never pointed to any mexw file). How can I point it to .mexw64?

          Thanks again,

          I think the clear command should make matlab look again on its path rather than using the last used file, I am not aware of any other possibility
          my output looks like this:
          >> which read_eep_cnt
          M:\FieldTrip\trunk\external\eeprobe\read_eep_cnt.mexw64

          note that I asked for read_eep_cnt and not read_eep_cnt.m (an important difference)
          did you try the clear statement I pointed to in my last comment? otherwise, try to restart matlab. it should actually work either way...

          otherwise try putting the mexw64-file anywhere else in your path

          I restarted Matlab, and from a fresh command line:

          >> clear all
          >> clear read_eep_cnt
          >> which read_eep_cnt
          C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2010a\toolbox\fieldtrip-20130903\fieldtrip-20130903\external\eeprobe\read_eep_cnt.m

          I also tried copying the mexw64 file to the "external" folder, and the "fieldtrip-20130903" folder, but it didn't make a difference.

          Thanks,
          Dan

          hm, that's very strange. Another thing you could try is to delete the .m file and see what happens. And as a last resort, you could try to get Matlab 32bit to read in the data...
          I am really confused why it does work for you while it does for me
