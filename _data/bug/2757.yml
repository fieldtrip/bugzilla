        thetext: I am analyzing data of a stabilometric platform (aka "balance board") and would like to analyze the data as one channel ("the channel of center-of-pressure fluctuations" / "the body sway channel"). When trying to obtain a power spectrum of the body sway data, ft_freqanalysis only returned zeros. Only when using two channels (e.g. by creating a dummy channel) it works fine.

          added to joint user because roemer might be absent ;)
          I think a similar bug has been filed before by an external someone, but I cannot find that bug back right now

          the same issue was addressed in another bug. However, I just made a dataset where I again have an error with a single channel. Hence I will follow it up at #2364
