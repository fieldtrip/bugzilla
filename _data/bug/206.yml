If there is no reason for it any more (*), then it should be fixed in rejectcomponent and potentially other functions that have the same bug.\n\n(*) which I expect: because of the recent implementation of sampleinfo, findcfg should not be used any more"

          this has now been reverted in ft_rejectcomponent, because it has become obsolete with the new trialinfo etc.
          I checked the rest of fieldtrip (main) by grepping in varargin and checking whether the cfg.previous was correctly assigned. This is now consistent throughout fieldtrip main
