          that was due to a small typo in the code, "dimtok" was not what it should be.

          I found this bug and am wondering if there is a solution now?

          At least, for me it still does not work. I downloaded a new version of ft last week (fieldtrip-20170511) with Matlab 2016B.

          I run these simple commands:
          cfg = [];
          cfg.layout = 'biosemi64.lay';
          cfg.metric = 'range';
          cfg.latency = [-.1 .6];
          ft_rejectvisual(cfg, data);

          The plot seems to work, but when I want to plot a specific trial ("Plot trial", to the left of the quit button), ft does not plot the trial number I entered; instead, it plots the LAST trial (or the average?). The matlab output actually states that whereas the figure title states the trial number that I entered.
