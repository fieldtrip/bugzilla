          I see that channel identification is disabled in vertical view. Presumably the reason for this is the implementation (looks like ginput is used to find the closest x/y location in data), but it would be great to revisit if it can be supported.

          I use the vertical view to mark bad trials, but it is also useful for identifying if bad channels are present. However, I use a 128 channel system, and channel labels don't seem to actually get plotted (even with 'some', perhaps another bug), so it is hard to identify which channel is the bad one. Instead, I have to remember which trials exhibit the bad channel behavior, load them up in butterfly mode, and select the channel there.

          Thanks!

          Hi Dean,

          for your application it seems that ft_reject_visual with viewmode 'trials' would be much more appropriate. Could you give it a try and see whether you prefer that over the databrowser?

          Jörn,

          ft_rejectvisual looks like a helpful tool -- I was not aware of it. It could be improved by implementing online y-axis scaling (instead of having to specify cfg.alim up front).

          Basically, I'm looking for a tool with which I can mark bad trials and bad channels (or at least note them to remove later) at the same time. Bad trials are easily identifiable with ft_databrowser in vertical mode. Bad channels are also easily identified in vertical mode, but I can't see the channel label with my setup for some reason -- hence needing to switch to butterfly mode, but then I have to remember the trials on which channels exhibited the bad behavior.

          All my scripts currently use ft_databrowser, but I will experiment with ft_rejectvisual over the next few weeks to see if I prefer it to ft_databrowser. The fact that you can plot all trials for a channel or all channels for a trial does seem like it could be helpful. Like I mentioned before, online y-axis scaling would be a welcome addition.
