        thetext: "the main purpose of this redrawing is to bring the artifact type to be marked in front (variable in code: ordervec - however, this does not mean that everything needs to be redrawn). for me, this is only apparent for component viewmode, but the same applies to the other two modi. \n\nsuggested fix:\n\n - look at the case 'component' in the redraw function. There, I tagged the artifacts boxes, which can, once tagged, independently cleared from the rest of the figure:\n\nset(h, 'tag', 'artifacts'); \n[...]\ndelete(findobj(h,'tag', 'artifacts')); )\n\nwhere 'h' is the figure handle\n\n - implement the same tagging for the other viewmodes\n\n - change the actionlistener of the artifact buttons to call a new function 'clear artifact'. code to be implemented is essentially the same as in the beginning of the redraw function\n\n - note that this function might still need to distinguish the special case of 'component' viewmode, because the graphical onset of the time courses is different from 'butterfly' and 'vertical'"

          small correction to how to tag handles:

          h_art = ft_plot_box(...)
          set(h_art, 'tag', 'artifacts')

          [...]

          delete(findobj(h,'tag', 'artifacts'));

        thetext: I will have a look at all the databrowser bugs and see which ones are applicable. Since we did not change the code, just the structure, I would suppose the answer to your question to be 'yes'
