        thetext: "Hmm, I kind of forgot from which dataset this was derived, but my hunch is that the difference in how both functions handle the data causes it. Could be an overlapping trigger issue.\n\nThe attached figure shows the trigger that causes the difference;\n\nread_ctf_trigger has a hard time dealing with the two triggers that seem to overlap in time.\n\nFor me this indicates that one should use 'UPPT001' rather than 'frontpanel trigger' to avoid this issue. \n\nIf somebody else however would like to try and fix this, go ahead"
