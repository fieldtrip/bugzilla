          I have managed to pull the diff into my laptop version, then push it to github/oostenveld.

          git checkout master
          git branch bug2036
          git checkout bug2036
          git pull https://github.com/gpiantoni/fieldtrip fiff
          git push origin bug2036

          I should now merge it into the master and pull the master into the special github-svn version.

          I reviewed the diff, and consider it safe to merge it into the release version ;-)

          So I do in the fieldtrip-github-svn version
          git pull oostenveld bug2036
          git push -> sends it to github
          git svn dcommit -> sends it to svn

          accidentally there were also some recompiled files from the realtime/bin/maci that went along. That should not be a problem, but those were not meant to be on the master branch.

          On http://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=7605 it looks ok.

          With svn update in an old fashioned repo it updates the affected file as expected. So it worked.

And it is indeed smart to check the procedure with export and subsequent read operation.\n\n@Hamid, I wanted to postpone this a bit (as I am traveling and very busy), but I'd to talk to you about you directly contributing. I guess that you are not familiar with git, but I had planned to ask you to make a github account, fork https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip and make the suggested changes in a branch of your own git version. I can then \"pull in\" the updates from your github account after reviewing them.\n\nThis is a new procedure which (hopefully) improves on managing external contributions. We also want to make more use of git internally to facilitate development, Search bugzilla for git, you'll find some items that relate to it.   \n\nPerhaps Gio could also help you a bit with this, as he is the first \"git\" contributor besides me (although he also has an internal donders svn account). It should all get documented on http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/git, just like http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/svn."

          It is a good idea that external people can also contribute. I signed up for git and will learn more about it and try to contribute especially on MEG neuromag.

          I did not have the MNE sample file yet, but am downloading it now.

          For the EEG I was a bit unsure to swap it out with another one, as you also specify a specific 256 channel EGI electrode set. I could look for one, but would prefer you to give me a (short) one so that I don't have to change other aspects of the script.

          Hi,

          Sorry to reopen an old bug, but I noticed that the test does not pass for test_fieldtrip2fiff:

          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dashboard/r9218/test_fieldtrip2fiff

          Actually, I cannot make out what the error is (according to the dashboard, it's "unknown", see http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/dashboard ). It seems to me that the test passes, but the format of the report is weird.

          Let me know if I can do something to fix it.
