        thetext: For statfun* and statistics* functions, 'design' is an explicit input, therefore should cfg.design be forcibly removed if isfield to avoid confusion?   cfg.design often is included due to being called by higher function which did legitimately use cfg.design

        thetext: indeed a good idea to rmfield design from cfg prior to passing it into the statfun. The cfg.design will always be teh original unscrambled version and should not be used. There are actually many more cfg fields that the statfun ideally should not be aware of.

        thetext: "I fixed this by removing design from cfg at the level of statistics_wrapper,\njust prior to the 'statmethod' being called.  \n\nNeither statistics_montecarlo or statistics_analytic seem to want a cfg.design,\nbut instead only use 'design' input.  \n\nHowever, statistics_crossvalidate has a weird line (72)\n>>  assert(isfield(cfg,'design'))  \nHowever, cfg.design doesn't seem to be used anywhere, instead the input\n'design' is used.  I have therefore also removed this line from this function."
