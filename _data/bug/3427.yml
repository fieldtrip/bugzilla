          This while I cannot find ft_spike_redefinetrial anywhere. Is such functionality somewhere else? (ie. after ft_spike_maketrials)

          Cheers,
          Stephen

          p.s. Any plans on doing a fieldtrip spiking tutorial? Anyone want to come to Paris? :-)

        thetext: "Good question about what happened to ft_spike_redefinetrial. \n\nThere has been no active development of the spiking functionality by the original developers, nor has there been commitment to keep documentation up-to-date with respect to the code in fieldtrip/external/spike.\n\nI went back to a zipped 2012 version of FT, and ft_spike_redefinetrial is not in that release, either. An earlier version (2010) did not contain the spike stuff in a dedicated folder, also there no redefinetrial.\n\nI will update the documentation of the function and then close this one, because I don't think that the function will show up all of a sudden again."
