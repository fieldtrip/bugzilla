        thetext: "Created attachment 819\nTest script to demonstrate a case, when dft-filter doesn't work\n\nThere is a bug in ft_preproc_dftfilter.m related to the (maybe rather unusual) case of data-lengths (and/or SR), where harmonics (of 50/60 Hz) need different numbers samples to apply the dft-filter. \n\nThere is already a loop to deal with this case (line 76),\nthat was introduced here:  https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/5efa0c76108993fee44d1fef7d9c006151bd74ff\n\nBut the filtering is not applied (only the last harmonic is removed), because the filtered data is overwritten with the original (unfiltered) data with each iteration in line 77: filt=dat;\nProbably the problem would be fixed, if this line is moved on top of the loop (e.g. to line 75)?\nThis bugfix is included in the commits (pull request) related to bug2956, adding \"spectrum interpolation\" to the ft_preproc_dftfilter."
