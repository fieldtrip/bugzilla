        thetext: With identical data and software/OS setup as reported in bug 2920 (by me), the title in the ft_databrowser is plotted very very tiny. It cannot be seen which trial out of how many is currently being viewed. This is a very time consuming bug, when having many, many trials to browse through.

        thetext: can be fixed manually in the plot editor, but still would be nice to have it straight away :)

          Font size is a general problem to be fixed in ft_databrowser, see bug #2203
