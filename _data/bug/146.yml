        thetext: "Since peerslave.glnxa64 is started from a cron job, it is impossible to check the output. Gathering information about the use and debugging unusual behaviour therefore is very difficult. \n\nIt would be nice if all peerslaves were able to report to a central logserver. The log file could include information about users, job requirements, the smartXXX handling and potential problems in job execution \n\nIdea: as a proof of concept and for testing, a  syslog mex file for linux would be nice to have."

        thetext: "Has been implemented using syslog and DEBUG macro. \n\nThe --verbose option can be used to determine how much dat is written to syslog (to avoid spamming it with debug info. Another useful feature (requires recompile) is LOG_PERROR for openlog().\n\nTested on OSX and Linux. \n\nNo recent attempt to compile on windows. Something else will have to be implemented (based on the DEBUG macro) for win32 and win64."
