          fixed + tested with own data. will send the new version to robert.
          posted new bug 630, which is not a severe one, but can help to improve the speed of the function.

          also another note: the code is really messy, because the function is quite extensive and handles many different situation. I think the code could still be optimized by breaking it down into more subfunctions. This will dramatically decrease time needed to work on this function. any thoughts on this?
