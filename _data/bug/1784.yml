          Added a README in SVN r6766. Maybe we should reconsider the naming of the platforms after the mex-file convention...

          NO, no message or error is displayed in demo_buffer.exe window, but matlab doesn't respond to command. I should use CTRL-C to stop the process in matlab!

This mex-file is currently a private function of FieldTrip; users are supposed to use ft_read_header etc. On a Windows 64-bit machine I did the following:\n\n1) Start win32 demo_buffer.exe.\n\n2) in MATLAB:\n>> ft_read_header('buffer://localhost:1972')\n??? Error using ==> buffer\nERROR: the buffer returned an error (517)\n[snip]\n \n3) start sine2ft.exe to create signals, and press 'connect'\n\n4) In MATLAB:\n>> ft_read_header('buffer://localhost:1972')\n[snip]\nans = \n\n             Fs: 2000\n         nChans: 16\n       nSamples: 60416\n[snip]\n\nThis shows that reading the header (2) gives an error (but it does not hang!). This happens because no data has been written to the buffer yet. When we create some data in (3), this succeeds in (4). \n\nCould you try to replicate these steps? And if you get different results, could you update to the latest version of FieldTrip, and see if the problem persists?"

          Hi Soheila,

          So, it does work with the sine2ft program, which shows that on the MATLAB-client side things are working fine. The error message states that it can't connect to this server. My hunch is that
          1) either the FT buffer server is running on a different port or address, or
          2) it is not running at all.

          You can try to pinpointing the problem by connecting deliberately to a non-existing server. Do you get the same message? If you do, you should attempt to find the correct address & port for your serving program. Perhaps you local technical staff can help you with this.

          I close this bug, since this is more user support than bug related. If you have more questions, please ask on the FieldTrip list.

          Boris

          No, the problem is not the server, because when I initiate the buffer inside the matlab, it works perfect!
          I've started using the realtime part of Fieldtrip for developing MEG neurofeedback in our lab since February. I'm familiar with addresses,TCP/IP connection, delay estimation and lots of other concepts related to this application of fieldtrip. In this point, I think the problem is with demo_buffer and at least in my Win7 machine, it doesn't work. For current applications, I can continue using internal buffer and the only problem is shutting down of matlab, but I'd appreciate if you could generate a 64bit Win7 compatible version of demo_buffer for future applications.


          Best Regards,
          Soheila
