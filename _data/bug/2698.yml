        thetext: This looks like a user error to us. In your error report there's no mention of a Fieldtrip-function being called explicitly. The only thing that could have happened, is that MATLAB is using the drop-in replacement of dpss in fieldtrip/external/signal/dpss_hack. MATLAB will only arrive here if your path settings have the mentioned folder higher on the path than the expected signal processing toolbox folder. Most likely this is caused by the user doing a addpath(genpath('')) type of thing, which is explicitly discouraged on the FieldTrip website. Please also have a look at the README documentation in the dpss_hack folder.
