          My solution. Quoted from my email to the mailing list:


          it seems like I solved the problem.

          If you export your data to the ieee floating point format the resolution entry vanishes. I assume that it is just don't needed anymore as the entries are in micro volt then.

          This was taken into account by the read_brainvision_eeg function until  12/08/2011. On This day a couple of changes were committed. Leading to the fact that ieee_float_32 data is also multiplied with the resolution

          ==================================================================================================
          if strcmpi(hdr.DataFormat, 'binary') && strcmpi(hdr.DataOrientation, 'multiplexed') && any(strcmpi(hdr.BinaryFormat, {'int_16', 'int_32', 'ieee_float_32'}))
          [...]
          calib = diag(hdr.resolution);
          % using a sparse multiplication speeds it up
          dat = full(sparse(calib) * dat);
          =============================================================

          The pre 12/08/2011 version looks like that
          ============================================================
          elseif strcmpi(hdr.DataFormat, 'binary') && strcmpi(hdr.DataOrientation, 'multiplexed') && strcmpi(hdr.BinaryFormat, 'ieee_float_32')
          fid = fopen(filename, 'rb', 'ieee-le');
          fseek(fid, hdr.NumberOfChannels*4*(begsample-1), 'cof');
          [dat, siz] = fread(fid, [hdr.NumberOfChannels, (endsample-begsample+1)], 'float32');
           fclose(fid);
          ==========================================================

          So ieee data was not multiplied by the resolution. Which is probably the correct behavior. I changed the function such that it doesn't multiply the ieee data with the resolution and it seems work. You can look at it here: http://matlab.nopaste.dk/p4635. The changes are just the if statements in line 67and 81.

          Testcase

          Attached find a test case including a test data set and the fixed read_brainvision_eeg.m. The test data set consists of resting EEG.

          (In reply to comment #3)
          While creating the test case it also came to my attention that the combination which causes the bug is multiplexed + float. Vectorized + float works fine.

          This bug is strongly linked to bug1618 which was fixed by setting the resolution to 1 if no resolution is present in the header. As bug1618 was fixed first I'll mark this bug as a duplicate.
