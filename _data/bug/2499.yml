          We got a report from a user who has 63 electrodes with extended 1020 labels but only a small subset of them is properly recognized by ft_chantype. This comes down to how ft_senstype and ft_chantype work together. On line 554 of ft_chantype ft_senslabel is called based on the output of ft_senstype. If the output is 'eeg1020' then only 21 labels are returned and the rest of the channel types are then set to 'unknown'. I don't think this is the right way to do it since different caps have different subset of 1005 labels and are not guaranteed to pass the thresholds defined in ft_senstype. What should happen is that for any senstype suspected to be extended 1020 the full list of 1005 labels should be matched. According to the user he had no problem in SPM8 so there might have been some recent changes that caused the problem.

          This sounds very similar to what I have already been solving in relation to bug 2463.
