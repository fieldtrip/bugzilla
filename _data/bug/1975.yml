          admittedly he didn't create his own page, but noticed that page freakingly fast though

          sure sure, the page should be informative and descriptive. I saw a number of pages which got shut down, because they were considered to be advertisements made with commercial interest. Quite important to not leave the impression that we're doing it for the money :)

          it should be an encyclopedic entry, not a "me too" entry. I suspect that wikipedia gets a lot of "link" spam, and that a lot of volunteers are therefore on top of cleaning it immediately. Detecting inappropriate "first pages" is  easier than scanning over the whole wikipedia.

          I was just going to add the link to the http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21253357 paper, but then saw the link to the FT wiki was removed (to avoid self-promotion I presume).
          But doesn't the peer-reviewed published article speak for 'notability'?

          better then point to the original article, not to an abstract. Idem for the website, http://www.ru.nl/donders/neuroimaging does not take you anywhere (not even under facilities) but http://www.ru.nl/donders/fieldtrip does.

          Have a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEGLAB for an example.
