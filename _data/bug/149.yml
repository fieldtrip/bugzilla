        thetext: "E.g. consider\n\npeercellfun(@pause, {3600, 3600, 3600, 3600})\n\nwhich would case a one-hour pause. Shortly after starting this, the user presses ctrl-C. The jobs will continue running, effectively blocking the busy slaves for one hour.\n\nMy idea is to implement a \"dead man's switch\", i.e. the master should announce every second that it is still interested in the job results. If the master fails to indicate its interest, the job on the busy slave is terminated.\n\nThis could (partially) be implemented using the matlab timer object. \n\nPS The matlab timer object could also be used to enforce a timavail in peerexec."

        thetext: "The general idea is that a job should be aborted if the master disappears. Using the onCleanup function in peercellfun now ensures that the master switches to zombie when ctrl-c is pressed. \n\nOn the slave side I tried implementing it using a matlab timer, but that was only able to execute an error outside of the workspace that was eval'ed. A possible, but undesired solution for the peerslave.m was to do an exit in the timer. For the command-line peerslave, the timer does not seem to work, probably because the engine does not have a java VM.\n\nIn the end, I did manage to implement something: on the master side it involves immediately switching to zombie on exit of peercellfun (also on a forced exit with ctrl-c). On the slave side it involves a kill-switch that is enabled during job execution and triggered if the master disappears.\n\nThe check_killswitch() function is executed at the end of the expire loop. It is enabled with the  option --killswitch 0|1."

        thetext: "it turns out that switching the master immediately to zombie on a ctrl-c has an unexpected side effect on the cmd-line peesslave as demonstrated by \n\npeerslave[90489]: starting MATLAB engine\npeerslave[90489]: executing job 1 from robert@MacBook.local (jobid=250879757)\npeerslave[90489]: failed to write jobdef\n\nand then it exits.
