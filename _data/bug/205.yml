          currently in th edocumentation and code the inner surface of the BEM model is referred to as "brain", whereas it should actually be the inner skull surface. This is highly confusing and should be fixed.

          Correct labels are
          - inner skull surface
          - outer skull surface
          - skin surface

          The name "brain surface" should be reserved for the folded cortical mesh, although given the potential confusion it is probably better to call that "cortical mesh".
