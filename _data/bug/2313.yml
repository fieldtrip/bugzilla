          it is fundamentally impossible to recreate the channel positions from component data, hence the chanpos in the grad/elec will be replaced by nans.
          This limits the use of the grad/elec structure in a few functions that rely on the chanpos field.

          -identify these functions (e.g. ft_prepare_neighbours (sometimes), ft_prepare_layout (sometimes), ft_channelrepair + the XXXstatistics)
          -probably the required change is to provide good documentation, and point to the existing templates for layouts and neighbourhood structures.
          -give meaningful error messages.

          Assigned to a named person, to push forward the resolution of this bug.
          Otherwise it just adds to the 'stuwmeer' of unassigned bugs, that nobody feels
          responsible for.

          Feel free to discuss how to address this (i.e. where to start, make a plan etc.)
