        thetext: While using Chronux toolbox for power and coherency, I had issues with tapers, specifically with Dpss and its check function. I spent many hours looking through code to make sure everything was correct. I then searched the internet and found out that Fieldtrip users were having similar problems. I then deleted the fieldtrip toolbox from my path and the taper dpss was resolved. I hope that this can be resolved in order to continue using field trip, but this seems like a serious issue.

        thetext: This is probably only a problem if you use the non-recommended way of adding the fieldtrip path to the matlab-path (i.e. by using something like 'add with subfolders' or addpath(genpath('...')) ). I suspect that the problem you refer to is that MATLAB defaults to the overloaded functionality of the dpss-related functions, which we provide as a courtesy to the users that don't have the signal-processing toolbox available. These set of functions should not be found, if the path is specified in the recommended way (i.e. only adding 'fieldtrip' to the path (without subfolders), and then issuing the ft_defaults command, which ensures that all minimally needed subfolders are added).
