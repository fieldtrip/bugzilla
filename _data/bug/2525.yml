          ft_read_event only considers EYELINK event types named "INPUT" but it generates much more as  LEFT,RIGHT,FIXATION,SACCADE,BLINK,MESSAGE,BUTTON. At the donders, most of the people use Bitsi.m to send triggers through serial ports and EYELINK code them as INPUT event type. In Frankfurt (ESI), Alina Peters and Ayelet Landau use the psychtoolbox function Eyelink('message','mymessage'), and the messages (behaving as triggers) are coded as MESSAGE EYELINK event types.

          Plan:
          ft_read_event should recognize all EYELINK event types to facilitate fieldtrip data processing

          Created attachment 603
          My proposed changes in the read_eyelink_asc.m function! Diego, what do you think?

          I made it so that Fieldtrip will split the lines with information about saccades and fixations into start time, end time, duration and so on.

          Next thing that would be useful is to be able to mark every data point in the time series as a part of a saccade or a fixation. But I couldn't find a fast way to compute it.

          Hi Alina et al.,

          Have you made any changes to this code since? Are you happy with how FT handles the events. I am starting my analysis of eyelink data here in Paris, and am also interested in using the events generated by the Eyelink software.

          Best,
          Stephen
