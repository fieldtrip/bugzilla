          Differences between current and proposed code

          I wanted to have scale bars on my TFR plots, so I modified the `ft_multiplotTFR.m` file to do so. Instead of using `ft_plot_matrix`, I added some code to create a new axes object and put the scale plot there. The effect can be seen in the attached "figures.pdf" file.

          One comment about the code: I switched from using `xas` and `yas` to using `data.time` and `freq` to enable the plot to reflect non-default `xlim` and `ylim` values.

          Elli, the diff you provide is not 100% OK :) I see two issues with it:

          - You explicitly use cfg.ylim, which might contain 'maxmin' as the default. Instead, ymin and ymax should be used (which are assigned somewhere early on in the function).

          - You put the scale plot at a hard-coded location, whereas this should be positioned according to the layout file. I can see some code apparently related to this, but then many of the variables (xas_pos, yas_pos, and some others) remain unused.

        thetext: The second problem is actually somewhat difficult, as it involves placing a subaxes in a figure using the `axis image` positioning scheme. I'll play around with it and hopefully I'll find a solution. If not, well, I guess I'll just keep using it just for my plots :)

          minimal working example of dynamically-positioned subaxis

          So, I've tried to fix the second point you mention, but I wasn't able to get it to work reliably. I was working with the following:

          - Question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7113836/how-to-position-an-axes-in-a-figure-relative-to-another-axes/
          - Answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7113836/how-to-position-an-axes-in-a-figure-relative-to-another-axes/7168940#7168940

          However, it seems that some of the manipulations we're doing to the axes at different points in the function cause this to not work appropriately. Specifically, in my testing, I've noticed that if you make any call to `axes`, it may or may not change the visibility of the sub-axes.

          Because of this fickleness, I'm going to change this to "CLOSED WONTFIX". Given that this is a minor change I don't think that should be a problem anyway. If someone wants to try to play with this later I'm including a "minimal working example" using the code in the above question (mytest.m); adapting it to the `ft_multiplotTFR` function, though, may take some work.
