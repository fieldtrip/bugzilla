        thetext: I encountered this when calling ft_prepare_headmodel with cfg.method = 'singleshell', and a segmented MRI in the input. ft_prepare_headmodel calls ft_prepare_mesh, which supports a cfg.method as well (expecting it to be either projectmes/isosurface/iso2mesh). The behaviour of ft_prepare_mesh is in this way not configureable. It can probably be bypassed by calling ft_prepare_mesh directly on the segmented volume, and pass the mesh on to ft_prepare_headmodel, but then I suspect that the support for segmented volumes in the input for ft_prepare_headmodel does not make much sense.

        thetext: "This issue is still open. \n\nIt's not so clear how to move forward here, because ft_prepare_headmodel has a cfg.method of its own, so it is not meaningful to pass on the cfg.method transparently to ft_prepare_mesh. If anything, we could consider a cfg.meshmethod or so, but this is also not ideal.\n\nSince this has been open for 3 years already, and nobody seems to care enough about it, I will close this for now, to be able to get a better view on bugs with higher priority."
