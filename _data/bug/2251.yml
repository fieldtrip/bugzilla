          the rss feed with recent messages on the email list has been broken for some time. I though that it was simply the cause of a script cronjob missing (it was), but getting the script to work again turned out to be difficult. The script is implemented in perl. and dccn-l024 (the webserver) does not have all required perl modules. I did not yet manage to get a working perl environment.

          For the time being I removed the following from the fieldtrip start page.

          ===== Recent messages on the email list =====

          {{rss>feed://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/fieldtrip-list.rss}}

          or use https://github.com/pteichman/mailman-rss
          which is python based. It still needs non-standard modules though.
