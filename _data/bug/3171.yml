The tutorial suggests that at some point spm12 was integrated in fieldtrip:\n\nhttp://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/human_ecog#processing_of_anatomical_data\n\n% co-register the CT to the MRI\ncfg             = [];\ncfg.method      = 'spm';\ncfg.spmversion  = 'spm12';\ncfg.viewresult  = 'yes'; % view realignment result\nct              = ft_volumerealign(cfg, ct, mri);\n\n\nBy the way, ft_volumerealign requires the desired head coordinate system in cfg.coordsys which makes the third input cofusing. For example, if ct is spm and mri tal, this combination does not work: \n\ncfg             = [];\ncfg.method      = 'spm';\ncfg.spmversion  = 'spm8';\ncfg.viewresult  = 'yes'; % view realignment result\ncfg.coordsys    = 'tal';\nct              = ft_volumerealign(cfg, ct, mri);\n\nbut this one works:\nct              = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri,ct);"

        thetext: "Lorenzo! Nice to see you're using/trying this freshly made pipeline. \n\n\"The tutorial suggests that at some point spm12 was integrated in fieldtrip\"\n> Actually, it says \"We then fuse the CT with the MRI, which are now both described in the same coordinate space, using SPM12. Note: currently (February, 2016) this requires downloading and adding SPM12 to the MATLAB path.\"\n\nThe integration of spm12 code is a separate bug/issue, file elsewhere. Of course, this tutorial would benefit from having it integrated.\n\nThe \"cfg.coordsys    = 'tal';\" part seems to be a requirement introduced recently. In sum, this should work (ensure you have spm12):\n\n% co-register the CT to the MRI\ncfg             = [];\ncfg.method      = 'spm';\ncfg.spmversion  = 'spm12';\ncfg.viewresult  = 'yes'; % view realignment result\ncfg.coordsys    = 'tal';\nct              = ft_volumerealign(cfg, ct, mri);"

          Hey Lorenzo,

          Spm12 is no longer needed on the path as of today. A mini version has been added to the external folder.

          Ciao!
