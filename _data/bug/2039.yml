          I am not able to read *.smr files, The first error I get,

          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
          ??? Undefined function or method 'mexprog' for input arguments of type 'double'.

          Error in ==> ns_SetLibrary at 39
          [ns_RESULT] = mexprog(18, filename);
          Error in ==> read_ced_son at 93
              ns_RESULT = ns_SetLibrary(which('nsCedSon.dll'));

          Error in ==> ft_read_header at 394
              orig = read_ced_son(filename,'readevents','no','readdata','no');
          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

          This is because matlab don't accept mexprog.dll anymore, I added mexprog.mexa64 to my path but I get this error:

          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
          ??? Error using ==> read_ced_son at 97
          Could not get NeuroShare library info, please use the NS_SETLIBRARY function.

          Error in ==> ft_read_header at 394
              orig = read_ced_son(filename,'readevents','no','readdata','no');
          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

          This is because when it calls ns_SetLibrary(which('nsCedSon.dll')); there is no nsCedSon.dll, I added this file but it does not work again


          I think this toolbox 'neuroshare' is old now and needs to be updated.

          If I replace the Neuroshare toolbox with the most recent version and add the nsCedSon.dll files (32-bit and 64-bit) it works for me but some adjustments have to be made to ft_read_data to switch between the 64-bit and 32-bit .dll file.

          I will follow up on this.

          The neuroshare toolbox currently distributed with FieldTrip is from 2003/2004, the most recent version (2.5) is from 2010 and can be downloaded here:

          http://sourceforge.net/projects/neuroshare/files/Matlab%20Import%20Filter/

          The most recent version of nsCedSon.dll (.dll created by CED to read .smr files) can be found here:

        thetext: the best would be to have a native implementation that does not rely on windows libraries. Ask the ced people directly for a working matlab implementation on linux. alternatively, ask for documentation and write the code yourself (i.e. Jim).
