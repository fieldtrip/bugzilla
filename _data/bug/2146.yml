        thetext: "on behalf of Ana:\n\nI've always run an ICA to remove eye blinks and heartbeat, but instead of saving the data file, I would save the unmixing matrix and then do the component rejection later, as a part of some other script. So far, I've always done this using the same number of components as there are MEG channels. This time I opted for using a smaller number of components, but I realized that it does not work unless I transpose the unmixing (i.e. comp.topo) matrix. To clarify, this is what I do:\n\n        cfg = [];\n        cfg.unmixing     = comp.topo';\n        cfg.topolabel     = comp.topolabel;\n        comp_data       = ft_componentanalysis(cfg, data); \n\nIf I don't transpose comp.topo, then I get an error saying that the number of channels is not accurate. Is this the way it's supposed to be? It is not clear from the text of 'help ft_componentanalysis', although there it is mentioned that the unmixing matrix is of dimensions NxN (and not NxM, which is my case). I'm now starting to wonder whether I should have always transposed this matrix."

        thetext: "Near the end of ft_componentanalysis, there is:\n\n% store mixing/unmixing matrices in structure\ncomp.topo = mixing;\ncomp.unmixing = unmixing;\n\nThus, I think you may be using the wrong matrix and instead should use:\ncfg.unmixing = comp.unmixing;\n\nPerhaps your 'comp' is from an older version which had .topo as output and no .unixing and .mixing?  \n\nEither way, I agree that the documentation should allow for 'unmixing' to be MxN (comps X channels)."
