          Created attachment 93
          screenshot with problem

          the letters in the boxes is garbled up (see screenshot). On my mac the svg figures look OK if I load/view them with AI, but in the browser they are not ok.

          I have attached the *.ai files.


          PS nice to have the announcement on facebook
