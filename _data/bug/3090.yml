          amici!

          which of your brilliant minds has implemented the intensity sliders in ft_volumerealign.
          I'm using Matlab2014b and only the left one is partially visible and hardly operable.
          Please look into whether the positioning within the figure can be done a bit more robustly.

          It wasn't me, Shaggy. Do you have the same issue with ft_electrodeplacement? Try ft_electrodeplacement([], mri). If I remember correctly, Roemer based the volumerealign sliders on the electrodeplacement implementation.

          Cocky?! I just never make mistakes (or no longer realize I make 'm :P).

          But maybe the captain was using an oddly sized MR, busting the sizes of the entire figure?

          For sure, its dimensions would exceed anything we can plot. In normalized units, it will even exceed 1.

          Roemer, can you look into this? At the Nijmegen toolkit we ran into problems for this function (leading to the function crashing), because we used MATLAB2012b. The functionality you wrote is not supported by older versions of MATLAB. We aim to be backward compatible for ~5 years, so please look into this.
          It has to do with the sorting of some handles in lines 1604-1606.

          Ouch! That's not supposed to happen of course. Sorry.

          Ha, funny. I always thought my coding was immune to this because of using 2012 for all those years. I thought wrong! I'll look into it.

          Yes, the tutorials were tested with the FT version we used. Yet, ft_volumerealign does not feature in the tutorials, but the problem showed up when people started doing their own stuff...

          Can this one be closed?

          Hi Roemer,
          Thanks for fixing. I placed a comment in the pull request, because it could be that the problem you originally stumbled into, also affects ft_sourceplot in matlab2014 and up. It would be great if you could have a quick peek.
