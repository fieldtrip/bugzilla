        thetext: "I was wondering if it might be OK to only give a warning when trials overlap instead of throwing a tantrum of red ink? Is there any practical reason not to 'support' overlapping trials? In my case i want to preprocess my trials according to slight shifts in timing, in one run, and sort it all out later. I need to use my own copy of selectdata now to circumvent the problem but see no reason why not to make it a 'feature'. \n\nbest, S"

          in case fetch_data is used (or will be used) in a ft main function, they cannot overlap. E.g. redefinetrial, databrowser.

          In case a subset of trials is selected, overlap should not be a problem.

        thetext: ft_redefinetrial now supports overlapping trials (see help). Would that fit your purpose?

          I closed all bugs that were resolved prior and including 2011-01-25.

          All resolved bugs should have been discussed by now, therefore we don't want to see them again in the next meeting. Instead, in the next meeting we want to see the recent improvements and fixes.
