          Greetings, 'trippers!

          Would it be possible to have ft_rejectvisual return trial numbers instead of sample numbers, for rejected trials? Fieldtrip gives back the sampleinfo for these trials, but I ran into a problem when trying to work out the correct trial numbers from this information. Namely, my dataset is a concatenation of several recordings, where the sampleinfo doesn't always grow in numbers from trial to trial (every added dataset starts from zero) - and for some reason the samples of the rejected trials didn't align well with the sampleinfo in the concatenated dataset. It worked well for early, but not late trials.

          There is already a variable in the ft_rejectvisual script called 'removed' that contains the information on rejected trial numbers. I fished it out on my local copy of fieldtrip, so it should be fairly easy to implement as the default. In the case of my data this information was accurate.

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
