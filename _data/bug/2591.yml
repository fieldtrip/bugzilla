          hi,
          in line 1481 of ft_databrowser, the data that was read in and prepared previously is put in opt.curdat. only later scaling is applied. this breaks identifying channels as this is working on the unscaled opt.curdat although (the scaled) dat is displayed.
          so, i would suggest that either identifying channels should work directly on dat or opt.curdat should contain scaled data.

          as i am not familiar with the internal workings, i do not know which of these solutions is better. maybe you prefer a third solution?

          best,
          thomas

          probably it was implemented completely disjoint, i.e. one person at one location in the code not thinking about the code that someone else added elsewhere.

          Could you try whether scaling opt.curdat works?

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #1)
          yeah, that works great. in fact, i just moved the creation of 'opt.curdat' after the scaling block and it works great.

          i created a push request here: https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/pull/42
