          only one more to go...

          @Daniel: could you outline what ft_leadfield_openmeeg is doing differently than ft_compute_leadfield/openmeeg_megm?

          I know that in ft_prepare_leadfield (the high-level function) there is an alternative way of looping over dipoles for openmeeg to make it more efficient, this is something Cristiano coded.

          But the main question pertains to the computational aspects, not the organizational aspects. Are the leadfields any different?

          Hi Robert,

          The new code no longer imports the inverse head matrix, which can be very large for higher density meshes. All computations are now done in openmeeg. Also, it offers support for ecog and internal point electrodes. And I don't think the old code allows for n-layers, if I recall correctly.

          Btw, I'm in leipzig with limited Internet access, so I'll have to catch up with everything on monday
