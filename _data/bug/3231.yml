          We are getting problems with plotting grads in ft_plot_sens (particularly for Neuromag but the problem might be more general). Error on line 228 'cannot work with balanced gradiometer definition'. This happens every time grad.tra was modified (e.g. by ICA or SSS montage). The old code which didn't plot the fancy squares was quite tolerant to that. Since these cases are getting more and more common I think it would be good to have a fallback option that would just plot sensor position as points as it did before.

          there is this section at line 108 which sets the default. I suggest you extend it so that the default is 'point' for balanced grads.


          if isempty(coilshape)
            if ft_senstype(sens, 'neuromag')
              if strcmp(chantype, 'megmag')
                coilshape = 'point'; % these cannot be plotted as squares
              else
                coilshape = 'square';
              end
            elseif ft_senstype(sens, 'meg')
              coilshape = 'circle';
            else
              coilshape = 'point';
            end
          end

        thetext: That won't prevent the crash because that bit of code runs for all Neuromag grads irrespective of coilshape

        thetext: I could just specify 'coilshape', 'point' in my code if that wasn't the case.
