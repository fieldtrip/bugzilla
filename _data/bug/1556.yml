          (In reply to comment #1)
          Hi,
          I compared the anovan function of matlab and the statfun_desamplesF in FieldTrip.
          To sum up (but details are below), it seems to me that the statfun_desamplesF doesn't give the same output when the experimental condition has more than two factor levels.
          (I will attach the script, called bug_desamplesF.)


          First, I compared the output of the anova function on a sample dataset of Matlab (called mileage) where I followed the steps described in the Matlab documentation (ANOVA with Random Effects). (For the computation being comparable to FT, first I had to delete some rows in mileage, because statfun_desamplesF can handle only 1 data per random factor per condition.)

          In this example data set, the fixed effect (called carmod) has 2-levels. The anovan gave the same F values for the fixed effect than the statfun_desamplesF.

          Then, I computed the same on the example data from Arno, and I got different F value with anovan and statfun_depsamplesF. When I deleted one of the conditions (there were originally 3), the F values were the same again.

          Lilla

          Hi , I checked it with my data and just want to confirm what Lilla already said: ft_depsamplesF output is different from the the anovan output if independent variable (cfg.ivar) has more than two levels.

        thetext: "Dear Eric,\n\nI'm continuing debuging the ft_statfun_depsamplesF function and I made some progress. The function ft_statfun_depsamplesF is providing wrong degrees of freedom for the error term and somewhat different F statistic as other software packages (SPSS and here  http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/corr3.html). As both procedures did not provide the open source code I found 2 ways to compute the ANOVA main effect for repeated measures (see my previous comment to replicate my conclusions). Both procedures (based on GLM and the sums of squares) gave me same identical results between them and also identical to SPSS and the website.\n\nI guess that there are multiple ANOVA models to test main effects but I coudn't discover what's the ft_statfun_depsamplesF way and I'd like to ask you if you could provide us a reference on were the original implementation was based and if you can confirm my results. In case both ANOVA models are valid, I propose to implement both in different functions. \n\nbest,\n\nDiego"

          (In reply to Diego Lozano Soldevilla from comment #6)

          Eric Maris pointed correctly that the model ft_statfun_depsamplesF function is testing is a MANOVA and NOT repeated measures ANOVA. Here critical point that explains the origin of the bug: it has been a documentation issue and not a wrong calculation

          Plans:
          1) Improve ft_statfun_depsamplesF to state clearly that MANOVA is the model one's testing
          2) Create a ft_statfun_depsamplesFmixedmodel to provide users with a repeated measures ANOVA testing a mixed model Fstatistic, as SPSS does.

          Thanks a lot for your help Eric!
