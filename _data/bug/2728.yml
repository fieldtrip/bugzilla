        thetext: "In this tutorial in the code examples at #plotting_the_results and #plotting_the_results1 the cases should be considered that \na) one wants to plot negative and positive clusters (this is only the case in the first example), and \nb) that there are either no negative or no positive clusters.\n\nI would suggest to enclose the relevant parts of the code with an if-statement:\n\nif ~isempty(stat.posclusters)\n  pos_cluster_pvals           = [stat.posclusters(:).prob];\n  pos_signif_clust            = find(pos_cluster_pvals < stat.cfg.alpha);\n  pos                         = ismember(stat.posclusterslabelmat, pos_signif_clust);\nelse\n  pos                         = false(size(stat.prob));\nend\n\nI can add that myself, I just wanted to ask before."

        thetext: "Hi Jens, \n\nI am in the process of cleaning up old bugs which have been open for a long time.\nIn the meantime it could be that the relevant code has changed anyhow...\n\nThis bug here inspired me to look in the tutorial, where I changed the wording such (hopefully) that nowhere is mentioned anymore 'significant clusters'. \n\nYet this was not the purpose of the original bug report, but I think that your suggested code changes pertain to ft_clusterplot. It seems that the code has developed since 2 years, so I am not sure whether your original question/concern still applies.\n\nI suggest for now to close this one, unless you strongly feel about reopening it: in which case feel free to do so."
