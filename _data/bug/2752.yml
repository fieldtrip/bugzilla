        thetext: "Hi all,\nI'm trying to run ft on MATLAB2014b under MacOS 10.10 (Yosemite).\nAfter some warning messages it plots the EMG and than it stuck and i have to quit MATLAB.\n \nHere the warning messages: \n Error in value of property  FontSize\n The Text being drawn is too big to render. \n> In defaulterrorcallback at 12\n  In uiwait at 81\n  In ft_databrowser at 740\n\nI tried also with older version of ft and i had the same problem. \nUnfortunately i can't try older version of MATLAB because 2014b is the only one that works under yosemite.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nMarco"
