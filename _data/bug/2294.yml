          I haven't heard back from Lennart yet but I found two recordings on 'H:\common\brainstim\toolkit\video recordings'

          One for Til's talk on tCS-TMS-EEG and a recording of Joern and my talk. I guess Gregor's talk was not recorded.

          Should I store the recordings on qnap-001?
