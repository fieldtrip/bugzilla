          We ran cluster based permutations using dependent sample t-test. 'maxsum' method worked but maxsize and wcm methods failed. the error was first on privet/clusterstat.m, line 292 stat(j) = -sum((abs(statrnd(negclusrnd==j,i)-negtailcritval)).^cfg.wcm_weight);

          we solved this by adding (negclusrnd==j) as index for negtailcritval. The function had to be modified elsewhere as well

          Hi Yuval,
          Do you by any chance mean line 342, rather than 292?
          Could you generate some small example data structure + some code for us to reproduce it? Even better, if you could also upload the patched clusterstat.m.

          the faulty function

          please download the data from my dropbox
          https://www.dropbox.com/s/254wafjd5bfrwgh/test.mat.tar.gz?dl=0

          to test the bug I ran

          s=ft_sourcestatistics(cfg,sub1sdOpen,sub2sdOpen,sub3sdOpen,sub5sdOpen,sub6sdOpen,sub7sdOpen,sub9sdOpen,sub10sdOpen);

          it got stuck on clusterstat (attached) line 342
          which was called by:
           ft_statistics_montecarlo (line 355)
           ft_sourcestatistics (line 204)

          verified and fixed.

          the scenario that failed was one which had a nonparametric_individual clusterthreshold, combined with cfg.clusterstatistic = 'wcm';
