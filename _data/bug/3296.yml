        thetext: "ft_multiplotER supports cfg.trials, which should result in the subset of trials being averaged on the fly. At this moment all trials are averaged and cfg.trials has no effect.\n\nThis was identified in relation to bug 2978. \n\nThe inspect_bug2978 script contains a (presently commented out) section that demonstrates the problem."

        thetext: "The data selection and handling inside ft_multiplotER is a mess. Parts of it date back more than 10 years ago. It would be good to rewrite the function, using a single call to ft_selectdata.\n\nI had a try at that, but failed due to the complexity of that function. Especially the bivariate and bidirectional case makes it hard to see how the present data management works. \n\nI suggest to start with a completely new \"ft_multiplotER_new\" implemented from scratch,  starting with the standard case, and only adding the bivariate and bidirectional cases later. \n\nPart of the challenge relates to it not being clear how the bivariate and bidirectional are currently working. A test script that includes those would be very valuable."

          while I am at it: I realize that ft_multiplotTFR probably suffers from the same problems.

          It would be wise to consider a private/multiplot_common fuynction that is shared between the two.

        thetext: The issue of data selection probably also applies to singleplot and topoplot. Possibly also movieplot.
