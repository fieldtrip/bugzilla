        thetext: "The changes to the grad+elec structure should be fully documented to the end user. That is possible in a same style as with ft_datatype_xxx. \n\nI have created an initial ft_datatype_sens with the historical record. The function also can do the conversion. All functions that now call fixsens should call this one instead. I also created an initial test_ft_datatype_sens script that currently still fails.\n\nTODO discuss with Jan-Mathijs how this should be fitted into ft_read_sens and other functions"
