          one channel interpolated

          When converting EEGlab to fieldtrip structure, files with interpolated channels are not processed correctly. Instead of saying the input is raw data with 36 channels (my data has 36 channels), if 2 channels were interpolated, it will say the input is raw data with 34 channels. In trying to run an FFT, the following error was thrown:

          Reference to non-existent field 'trial'.

          Error in ft_freqanalysis (line 382)
          ntrials = numel(data.trial);

          No error occurred when converting a file with no interpolated channels.

        thetext: the file 164_MIST_prac.fdt is missing from the dataset, hence EEGLAB cannot import it. Can you also share that one? It will be much bigger than the *.set file, so I suggest using one of these http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_should_i_send_example_data_to_the_developers

          Sorry about that. The fdt file is now available as well.

          I have confirmed the bug. The issue is with ft_selectdata (which is used inside ft_freqanalysis) and can already be replicated with

          data = eeglab2fieldtrip(EEG, 'preprocessing', 'none');

          cfg = [];
          cfg.trials = 'all';
          cfg.channel = 'all';
          data1 = ft_selectdata(cfg, data);

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #3)

          length(data.label) is 35, whereas the data matrix has 36 channels.

          I solved the problem by updating fieldtrip/external/eeglab/eeglab2fieldtrip to the latest version from EEGLAB '$Id: eeglab2fieldtrip.m,v 1.6 2009-07-02 23:39:29 arno Exp $'.

          Sending        external/eeglab/eeglab2fieldtrip.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 10122.


          The test script now works fine.
