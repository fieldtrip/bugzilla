Sample data file that causes the crash can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1secH_W-I-afX3CN6MCrpxmloNqYvTiGZ\n\nI am a new FieldTrip user. I am trying to run a script that a colleague has sent me, which is basically a wrapper script to call the ft_freqstatistics calculations. They work fine on his computer, which has a 2012 version of FieldTrip and Matlab 2013a. \n\nBut when we try to run either a later version of Fieldtrip (e.g. 2015) or a later version of Matlab (e.g. 2017b), we get the following bug:\n\nError using findcluster (line 50)\ninvalid dimension of spatdimneighbstructmat\n\nError in clusterstat (line 201)\n      posclusobs = findcluster(reshape(postailobs, [cfg.dim,1]),channeighbstructmat,cfg.minnbchan);\n\nError in ft_statistics_montecarlo (line 348)\n  [stat, cfg] = clusterstat(cfg, statrand, statobs);\n\nError in ft_freqstatistics (line 193)\n    [stat, cfg] = statmethod(cfg, dat, design);\n\nThe bug seems to occur irrespective of whether we are running the analyses on PC or Mac. \n\nI have just recreated the bug with a clean install on a Mac, with the latest version of Fieldtrip and Matlab 2016a. \n\nI attach the wrapper script and a sample dataset that causes the crash on our systems.\n\nMany thanks, \n\nSam"

        thetext: "Thank you Robert. Just wanted to clarify: these data come from a single EEG channel, and the dimensions of data are 24 subjects x 14 frequencies x 81 time samples. If the issue is due to incompatible neighbor specification (3x3), how should it be set for 14 frequency bins? We currently don't specify neighborhood, and probably a default (3x3) is used at some stage of clustering. \n\nMany thanks,\nValdas"

        thetext: "(In reply to Valdas Noreika from comment #6)\n\nThe geometrical dimension (one channel) is also relevant, although it is a singleton-dimension. \n\nClustering fails is implemented for space (channels or source positions), time and frequency. In your case there is no cluster over multiple channels, but time and freq are still interesting to cluster over. You probably should add cfg.neighbours=[] to indicate to ft_freqstatistics that you are not interested in spatial neighbors.  \n\nI think that gloqspctrm should be 1x24×14×81 and that dimord should be chan_rpt_freq_time... although, more commonly (since compatible with TFR analysis with keeptrials=yes) would be rpt_chan_freq_time and hence 24×1x14×81. \n\nFieldTrip has gotten smarter over the years in terms of dealing with flexible dimensions in the data, so chan_rpt_freq_time might work, but rpt_chan_freq_time (with one channel) should work."
