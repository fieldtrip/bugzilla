        thetext: "Hi Nietzsche,\n\nThis bug is a placeholder for documenting what happened with the material. \n\nI renamed the folder on the qnap to include this bug number (to cross link it).\n\nRegarding photo's, I suggest you post a section on facebook. That requires you to become administrator of the fieldtrip page (as are many others of us). Can you send me your facebook account name (assuming that you have one) by email?\n\nRobert"
