          In the current FT version, a lot of the heavy lifting in findcluster() is done by a mex-file combineClusters (if available). It would be great if we can do it even faster by just using matlab code, but it's worth checking that the mex-file is actually being used when doing benchmarking (as an m-file fallback is also available).

          Also, there are two general cases of clustering: (1) across channels, which is an irregular dimension requiring neighbourhood structure; and (2) only across regular dimensions. These two might result in different decisions as to which code is fastest.

          Eelke's mex-file based merging of clusters across space (channels) seems to be substantially faster than the limo implementation.

          I quickly checked this on windows machine using matlab2016b. Although not extensively tested on all platforms, shapes of onoff matrices and neighbourhood matrices etc I don't see the need to invest in this at this moment.
