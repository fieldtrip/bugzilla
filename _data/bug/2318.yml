          To increase paging speeds the data will be loaded in the figure as one long trial (continuous case) or as concatenated trials (epoch case), and the GIU will manipulate axis limits for navigation.

          There is a concern by Robert about data doubling that needs to be addressed.

For some functionality that might be relatively easy (like the datacursor) whereas for other functionality it might be more difficult.\n\nPerhaps it helps to list the various functionalities and see whether might be possible that they are en/disabled, or which ones are opposites of each other (i.e. toggles). Here is a list of functionalities, I tried sorting them in the historical order of when they were conceived\n\n-  view continuous data from disk\n-  view continuous data from memory\n- select segments as artifacts\n- page through the data using the < and > button\n- view segmented data from memory one segment as a time\n- view segmented data from memory one segment as a time\n- scroll through the data using the scrollbar\n- select segments and execute a function on them\n- identify channel, latency and value in a signal of interest"
