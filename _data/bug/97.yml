        thetext: "Selectdata is working in an unexpected way. If the user explicitly states cfg.trials = [], no trials are to be processed. The current functionality is that if isempty(selrpt), no selection of trials takes place, and thus all trials are processed subsequently. This is the result of keyval being used, but the output of keyval being inappropriately processed. \nSolution: if the user explicitly specifies a 'key', then use the next input argument as the corresponding 'value'. In such case [] has a definite meaning (rather than not being defined by the user)"

        thetext: "As of recently the test_bug97 script fails with \n\nError using ft_selectdata_old (line 133)\nft_selectdata_old does not work when selecting 0 trials; please use ft_selectdata_new instead (use a cfg input, instead of key-value pairs, to ft_selectdata). \n\nThis is after it doing\n\ncfg        = [];\ncfg.trials = [];\ndatax      = ft_preprocessing(cfg, data);\n\nwhich is rather ambiguous. Since Jan-Mathijs seems to have been working on (and thinking about) this recently, I reopen this bug and assign it to him."
