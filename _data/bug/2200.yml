          Right now there is on the front page a link to community and a link to contact, but neither is explicit about where to get support.

          Hidden under development there is the short section about bugzilla.

          I suggest to document the faq "How to get support?" (of course locate it on the faq page) and also inline-include that into both the community and contact pages.
