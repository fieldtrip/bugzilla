          Two issues:

          - The /test/ directories are included in the hashtable, but they should not be (they are not included in the FTP release).

          - Some files, even though they are at the same revision, apparently result in a different md5sum in the working copy on the SVN server from the md5sum when computed on the file in the FTP release (which, in turn, is the same md5sum when I compute it on my own working copy). Strange. I am investigating.

          I tracked the second issue, for the example case of specest/private/ft_getopt.m, to line 29. My own working copy, and the one included in the FTP release, read:

            % $Id: ft_getopt.m 5076 2011-12-22 13:40:40Z borreu $

          But the version in the SVN server's working copy reads:

            % $Id: ft_getopt.m 5384 2012-03-05 09:15:35Z roboos $

          Which I do not understand, since the SVN server's version also is at revision 5076:

          immediately following svn update on my laptop I see

          Checking out a new working copy on the SVN server results in the correct Id-tag within specest/private/ft_getopt.m.

          So, re-checking out a fresh working copy for the autosync and hashtable scripts should solve the problem.

          (In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #11)
          Thanks for looking into this, Robert.

          Actually, I'm using R2017b as well. So I dug a bit deeper, and found 'ver' handling links given as path argument not consistently. (Background is, that I download the ftp version daily, and have a link 'latest' pointing to that directory allowing users to always have the _latest_ fieldtrip version in use.)

          The 'ver' command intersects two lists internally, one generated in line 290 by the 'what' command on the argument given, and the entries on the matlab path as the second one. Unfortunately, the former reports canonicalised paths, while the later does not. When the intersection of the lists is empty, 'ver' returns an empty structure.

          I would appreciate, if you could handle the case of 'ver' returning an empty structure somehow without fieldtrip exiting with an error. Why not return the same struct with static information you quoted in your last comment?

          Meanwhile, I will try to figure out, why this issue came up only recently, as we've been using this link to the latest downloaded version of fieldtrip without this issue for a couple of years.

          P.S.: I also contacted The MathWorks with regard to the behaviour of the 'ver' command.
