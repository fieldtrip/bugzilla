          Hi Verena,

          Can you get me a copy of the workshop video material? I don't care how it is shared over the internet, as long as you don't try to attach it to this bug ;-)

          Robert

          Hi Robert,
          I just spoke to the person who recorded it. Given that some manual work is required on the last lecture tape, because some automatic synch did not work properly, its not yet ready. I will keep an eye on it and notify you.
          Probably about two weeks..Then I will see how I transfer it.
          Cheers, V

          I have processed the material in Premiere Pro, with some help from Jorn.

          The resulting video (~600MB) is available on dccn-qnap001:/fieldtrip/video.
          The Adobe project file is also present there.

          I will send it to Hamburg and ask for their material.
