          current results of clusterstats erf tutorial

          Compare http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/_media/tutorial/cluster_permutation_erf/clusperm_erf_topos_raweffect_ficvsfc_pl_ga.png which features here http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/cluster_permutation_timelock?&#plotting_the_results to the attached plot.

          I've set colormap to jet to make them comparable. The time and location of the significant cluster is unchanged, which is a good thing. However, the effect seems to last much longer in the plot on the wiki than in my new plot. This is not just a zlim issue (I've checked).

          I'm updating the plot on the tutorial wiki for now (given the London workshop starting tomorrow), but it would be good if someone looks at where this discrepancy is coming from.

        thetext: It's unclear what the status of this one is, but given the fact that we're severely underpowered in terms of people contributing to fixing issues on bugzilla, Robert and JM have decided to close the low-priority bugs for now. This in order to keep the number of open bugs manageable. Feel free to reopen it, if you are willing to move this one forward towards a more proper resolution.
