          The tutorial for multivariate analysis
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/multivariateanalysis is lacking figures. According to Robert, they should be there.

          @Ali + Marcel,

          Hi guys, we are going over some bugs at the moment, and this one pertains to the tutorial for multivariate analysis. Does any of you remember what these figures should look like? There are a few figures attached to the page, but they are not linked, so invisible to the end user. If you click 'edit this page' and then click on the fifth icon on the right (that will allow you to add figures to the page), you'll see which figures once were uploaded to be associated with this page. Feel free to add them back.
