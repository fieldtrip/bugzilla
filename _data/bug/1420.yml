        thetext: "every single assertion fails (i.e. for all datatypes). the stored freq in \\home\\common\\matlab\\fieldtrip\\data\\test\\latest\\freq\\ always differs from the data that is computed on-the-fly. \n\nsometimes, difference are big, sometimes small, sometimes for many samples, sometimes for few. but we are dealing with mathematics here, which should be exact, so what goes wrong? It is not revision 5106, which made detrending default behaviour.\n\nI don't feel like going back 3000 revisions, testing every single change that occured... I already went back to r4608 in Google code, and I cannot see what might have changed. the stored data is from last year (feb-apr 2011)\n\nBoris, do you have information from what revision onwards this test failed?"

        thetext: Okay, I just met Jörn, and we can't easily identify a revision in which the test script ran successfully. This might be caused by a change in the path for the reference results --- which is not versioned in the repo. The best approach is probably to re-save the latest results, and work backwards in time to so when it starts to fail again.

          Reopened because test script fails
          it fails because of 'different size in array.grad.chanunit{:,1}'
          freq.grad.chanunit was 'unknown'
          datanew.grad.chanunit is 'T', now

          action: overwrite old data on disk

        thetext: the testscript still fails, but now due to differences in powspctrm. I checked on a mentat and the test passes, so I guess it is again caused by differences in matlab versions. How to fix?

          how large is the difference? if it is in the "eps" range, the test script should be made rubust to the difference. Besides MATLAB isequal, there is alsy my test/private/identical function that allows relative and absolute tolerances. I believe that the xunit toolbox also has such a isalmostequal function.

          the discrepancy happens at dataset 10 (CTF275 data)
            [ok,msg] = identical(freq, datanew,'reltol',eps*1e6);
          which is 2.2*10^-10, so around
          0.0000000001
          but the max-ratio in matlab 2012b is
          1.00000014

          what a bummer :) similar issue at dataset 12 (itab153), but there the difference is 2.29*10^-10

          I guess a re-write is safe?

          well, it still sometimes bounces from passed to failed, but currently it's status is:
          ooooxoooo!

          if it fails more often, we could increase the identical threshold.

          For the last fail, I increased memory requirements:

          svn ci test_ft_freqanalysis.m -m "increases memory requirements by 0.25gb"Sending        test_ft_freqanalysis.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 9122.
