          I have removed some mex files (nansum and friends), and added a new version a few commits later. These new files didn't have the autosync property that tells the SVN server to update all related copies. Fine.

          So, in https://code.google.com/p/fieldtrip/source/detail?r=6591 I added the property, and expected that this would take care of syncing all files. It didn't. The files are now all have the autosync property, but are in different states.

          Perhaps this is for safety reasons, but I think it is unexpected.

          I just reopened #1768, because files with the autosync tag were not in sync. I discovered that the checksums of linked files differed.

          Imagine the following scenario:
          1) Files that have the autosync property, and have the same file name are meant to be the same file.
          2) Let's call the linked set of files a group.
          3) If a group has files with different checksums, there is a violation — this is a state that has to be resolved by they autosync script. Checking changes in a new commit is a sufficient condition given an valid initial state.
          4) Violation (3) can be resolved by propagating the newest changes to the rest of the group.
          5) Commit, and everything is valid again.

          Of course this is complicated by additional properties (executable bits, other tags).

          Ok, there is probably a series of false positives due to the $Id tag of SVN:

It does not know however about checksums, it only knows that one exemplar from the group has been updated, it copies it over the other exemplars and commits.\n\nHowever, you are apparently able (due to some subtle difference in how you do updates compared to how other do it) to break the script. The script breaking is something  the script cannot be made robust against. So item 4 and 5 are part of the current script (but not based on checksums), but sometimes they are not executed.\n\nMight it be that you are not doing an svn update following your svn commit and that therefore your other copies are not updated?\n\nHave a look in /home/svnroot/fieldtrip/hooks/post-commit-autosync \non the svn server (you can open that file after logging in with your normal account)."
