        thetext: "Created attachment 587\ndata with our 61 eeg labels, being cut to 21 in the current ft version\n\nSince fieldtrip-20140121 functions using the option \"cfg.channel = {'EEG'}\" give different results from fieldtrip-20130901.\n\nChannels that were previously included in the analysis are now stripped from the data. Investigation shows, that the behaviour of ft_channelselection seems to have changed, probably due to changes in ft_senstype. Channels that were previously included in the \"EEG\" subset are now stripped, probably due to an intersection with a smaller list of candidates returned by ft_senslabel in connection with changed classification by ft_senstype (see example).\n\nWith attached example data, 61 channel subset of an extended 1020 setup (IFCN 10/10 afaik):\n\ndata = \n    label: {61x1 cell}\n\n\n- fieldtrip-20130901\n\nft_senstype(data.label)\nans = ext1020\n\n- fieldtrip-20140121\n\nft_senstype(data.label)\nans = eeg1020\n\n\nThis leads to our data being reduced to the 21 channels that intersect with the 1020 system.\n\nMaybe related to bug 2028."

I will change the selection around, i.e. if 80% of your channels are in the 1010 set, it seems that eeg1010 is an appropriate label for the set, even though you only have 61 from the (predefined) 86.\n\n\nroboos@mentat001> svn commit \nSending        forward/ft_senstype.m\nTransmitting file data .\nCommitted revision 9323.\n\nThis should fix it.
