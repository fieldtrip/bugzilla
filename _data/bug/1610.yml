          The layout automatically created based on data.grad for the ctf151 system (and possibly others) has an almost non-existent width and height. The pos fields are also different (not priority to check atm).

          This can be replicated by using e.g. freq-output from the time-freq tutorial and doing an empty cal (ft_multiplotTFR([],data), or by changing test_ft_multiplotTFR to use the ctf151 test-data.

        thetext: "Bug originated from ft_prepare_layout, were width and height are determined by the minimum distance between projected channel locations, based on grad/elec.\n\n\nBug fixed, improved (hopefully in all cases) the determining of distance between channel pairs. \n\nPreviously, the width of a channel was 0.8 of the minimum non-zero distance between all projected channel locations. \n\nNow, the width of a channel is 0.8 of the median of the first/closest quartile of the non-zero distance to the closest neighbor of each channel.\n\n\nI'm CC'ing you JM, as you made the last known change to the automatic determining of channel width and height (sens2lay subfunction of ft_prepare_layout), correcting it for machine precision (which though, in the case of the ctf151 system, was not conservative enough). Also CC'ing you, as my changes here will probably affect many users not using their own layout (and it's good to spread the awareness in this 'default' change ;))."

        thetext: As an additional comment, the reason for my more complicated definition was that, in the case of the ctf151 system, the minimal non-zero distance (even after using a more liberal detection of '0') was still very small. A few channels, which were extremely close to each other, thus caused all other channels to become unreadable tiny squares (but visible). After the changes I made, much more of the available screen space was used, at the cost of a few channels maybe overlapping. Although, in the case of the ctf151 system, I didn't see any channels overlapping afterwards.
