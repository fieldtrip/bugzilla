Once that is conformed, please start editing \n\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/plotting\nto create three sections (channel, volumetric, surface). \n\nSubsequently I suggest you start to work on the volumetric section, taking inspiration from the channel section."

          Nietzsche, can you make sure to upload your volume pos-freq-time data to the cluster so I can use it for this tutorial? Thank you!

        thetext: right, it's called "pos_freq_time". I'll leave you with the job of finding a more suited name for the tutorial.

          just for reference, I suggested to Remco to add some short screen capture movies.

          Perhaps this is useful (in case you have a mac) https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207

        thetext: "Created attachment 706\ndemo gif - full screen\n\n(In reply to Robert Oostenveld from comment #5)\n\nI tried it with a screen recording of my full screen while I was opening the fieldtrip home page. The original resolution is way too high ar 2560x1600 @60Hz\n\n\nffmpeg -i in.mov -s 600x400 -pix_fmt rgb24 -f gif - | gifsicle --optimize=3 --delay=3 > out.gif\n\n\nmac011> ls -lh in.mov out.gif \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 roboos  staff    17M Mar  2 18:06 in.mov   % original\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 roboos  staff   1.5M Mar  3 09:07 out.gif  % output\n\nThe 1.5 MB is quite OK at 600x400 and the original refresh rate (the gif has almost 900 frames). The refresh rate could be lower (say 20 Hz) and for the wiki it would suffice to have 400x300 for a large figure and 300x200 for a small one. Here is a smaller one\n\nffmpeg -i in.mov -s 400x300 -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 20 -f gif - | gifsicle --optimize=3 --delay=9 > out.gif\n\nmac011> ls -lh out.gif \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 roboos  staff   469K Mar  3 09:18 out.gif\n\nLet me attach this one as demo. It is a bit stretched (the aspect ratio does not match the original). Had it not been for downsampling from 2560 to 300, then I think it would have looked quite ok. Lesson learned: I should start with a MATLAB figure that has the correct pixel dimensions. \n\nI would not mind making the gifs on my computer, now that I know how it works. You still would have to share the data and script with me."

Using the same data would make it easier for users to understand\nThis is related to bug 2516 - and is currently in progress.\n\n% ERF data\n3. plotting source-level ERF data (MNE)\n\n4. channel-level connectivity\n- there was some old code that worked, but the figure was suboptimal\n\n5.
