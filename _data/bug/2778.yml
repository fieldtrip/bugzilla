Safer would be to initially only copy the administrative fields (label/trialinfo etc) from detain to dataout and explicitly insert all fields that should be retained/recomputed."

          Committed revision 10040.

          I cleaned up the overall code. The test_ft_regresscounfound is doing fine, I was not able to check the other test script as I don't have the data here. That should be followed up on the dashboard.

          agreed, thanks. for ease of observation, this is the fix you implemented:

          % prepare the output, start with only the administrative fields
          dataout = keepfields(datain, {'label', 'time', 'freq', 'pos', 'dim', 'transform', 'inside', 'outside', 'trialinfo', 'sampleinfo'});
