          multiplotER with fieldtrip-20110623

          Hi,

          I plot an event-related field average of the tutorial data with fieldtrip-20110623, using ft_multiplotER, and it looks like this (see attached figure). The sensor positions and the schematic head are not well aligned.

          Hey Lilla,

          Are you using a layout? I had a similar issue when not using a layout, using cfg.layout='CFT275.lay' removes this issue. I had a chat with JM about this last week (of course, the issue then still remains that the circle representing the head is still not nicely aligned when not using a layout)

I just did what is written in the event-related averaging tutorial:\n\ncfg = [];\ncfg.showlabels = 'yes'; \ncfg.fontsize = 6; \ncfg.layout = 'CTF151.lay';\ncfg.ylim = [-3e-13 3e-13];\nft_multiplotER(cfg, avgFIC); \n\nLilla"

          although not extremely beautiful, all sensors ER plots are inside the head (see attachment). this depends on how the ER window is placed. the center location position is nicely spaced, see http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/_media/template/ctf151.lay.png
          or
