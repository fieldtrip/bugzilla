          Yoni reported another problem at http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=798#c19 which initially seemed a problem with ft_appendfreq (see bug #931) but which turned out to be a numerical accuracy problem.

          After discussing with JM, we decided that appendfreq and selectdata should not be calling each other and should not depend on each other. They both serve a clear and unique purpose. In this case ft_freqstatistics should not be calling appendfreq, but selectdata.

          I created a test script based on the input from Yoni, it includes the test data (from home/common)

          Thank you for having resolved the bug so rapidly.
          Could you please indicate the exact location (all relevant directories) of the test script that you created (you wrote 'fieldtrip/test/test_bug932.m')

          Sending        utilities/ft_datatype_sens.m
          Transmitting file data .
          Committed revision 7144.

          The function now checks on the output labels that are returned by private/channelposition. If these are inconsistent with sens.label, it uses nan instead of the computed positions.
