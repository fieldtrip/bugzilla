          the beamformer tutorial contains some flipdim stuff that is outdated (spm2 specific) and that should be updated.

          There is already a shared section on "Checking your segmented volumes" at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/shared/flipdim which is also used in the beamforming tutorial. The flipdim has to be removed from the beamforming tutorial and has to be exclusively part of the flipdim section. Ie. merge the beamforming and flipdim and ensure that it is correct.

          I also suggest to remove segmentedmriF as variable, and only work with segmentedmri, i.e. do the flipping in place. The segmentedmriF.mat file needs to be removed and replaced by the correct segmentedmri.mat file.

        thetext: "The beamformer does no longer contain flipdim related text. \n\nThe shared/flipdim page now points to the correctly segmented mri in stead of segmentedmriF.mat. The latter has already been removed from the depository.\n\n\n\nWhat still needs to be discussed is whether the flipdim calls in some example scripts are now redundant. Such as in:\n\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/create_single-subject_grids_in_individual_head_space_that_are_all_aligned_in_mni_space\n\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/make_leadfields_using_different_headmodels"

          Removed the flipdim here:
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/example/create_single-subject_grids_in_individual_head_space_that_are_all_aligned_in_mni_space

          On this page flipdim is more or less used as an example of how to flip and not presented as necessary. Therefore, it is not removed.
