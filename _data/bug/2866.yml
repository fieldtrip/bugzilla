          I have not created a link on the FAQ page yet. Will do so after I've added some content

          Hi Jim,

          I came across

          http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/how_does_a_difference_in_trial_numbers_per_condition_affect_my_statistical_test

          and noticed it is not yet complete. If it not going to be further extended, please clean it up, remove the warning and finalise it as is. Otherwise please add whatever you had planned and also get it over with.

        thetext: "Hi Robert,\n\nI forgot about this after not having looked at this because simulations using FieldTrip structures took so incredibly long. I now ran a simulation with 20 subjects (100 tests using ft_timelockstatistics, 2 conditions, 100 trials per condition, paired t-test). This simulation took 4369s (72 minutes). I ran the profiler and found that more than half! of the time was spent in ft_version called by ft_preampble_provenance (see attached image). \n\nThis line is causing most of the delays: [status,output] = system('svn info');"
