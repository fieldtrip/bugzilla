          There is a small glitch in the way trl is handled with checkdata. I'm running ft_dipolesimulation (which does not create a trl structure) and then I want to plot the data using ft_databrowser.

          ft_databrower calls checkdata, which calls fixtrialdef. The problem with fixtrialdef is that it creates a trl but instead of adding it to the cfg (where ft_databrowser expects it), it adds trialdef to data.

          My workaround at the moment is to call
          ft_dipolesimulation
          data = checkdata(data, 'datatype', {'raw', 'comp'}, 'hastrialdef', 'yes');
          data.cfg.trl = cat(2, data.trialdef, zeros(size(data.trialdef,1),1));
          ft_databrowser

          Is it possible to add data.cfg.trl directly within fixtrialdef?
          And what is trialdef (which is different from the trialdef of ft_definetrial) and how is it different from trl?

          Thanks for the great toolbox!

More information about this can be found here:\n\nhttp://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/ensure_consistend_trial_definition\n\nI am currently in the process of converting all function with a call to findcfg(data.cfg, 'trl'), to use the trialdef (if present).\nI will move up ft_databrowser on the priority list..."

          will write some documentation soon. Yet the idea was to make all the changes transparent to the end user (didn't work apparently ;o)).
          Your bug has been fixed by the way. Fixed version should be available on the ftp-server as of tomorrow. Could you let me know whether it works for you after updating? (without the workaround) Then I can close the bug.
