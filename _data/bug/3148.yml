          The script contains this

          ------------------------------------
          %% Test script, by Johanna

          ft_defaults;
          swd='/data/johzum/delange2008data/';
          % this resides on both mentat248 and mentat269
          % the raw data is from Biomag 2010 competition
          cd(swd);
          cfg.dataset = '/data/johzum/delange2008data/dataset02.ds';
          ------------------------------------

          which fails because the data is nowhere to be found. I checked the donders FTP server according to http://megcommunity.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=2 but it does not have the data any more.

          Does any of you still have the data?

          No worries, Johanna! I would be perfectly fine with closing this one.

          Hope all is well.
