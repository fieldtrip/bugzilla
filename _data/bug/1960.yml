        thetext: "Nexstim data has square pulse triggers. So there are two events 'rising' and 'falling' and there should be an equal number of both events.\nBut for a few datasets ft_definetrial() fails to find 1 or more 'rising' events.\nThere is no equivalent problem for 'falling' events. \n\nAn example dataset and the corresponding script can be downloaded here:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/w2fwfetktyc1fmy/sQy2acL6YM"

          Hi Renate,

          Apologies for taking so long to get back to this. When looking at your data, I only see triggers in the TRIG1 channel. These all seem to have the same value. Could you give me some more information what the exact voltages in the trigger channel(s) mean, and how I can verify that the correct amount of events indeed is 90 per type?

          Thanks!
          Eelke

        thetext: "Hi Eelke, \n\nthank You for getting back to me. The triggers do indeed all have the same value and the exact voltages do not have a meaning. Events in the experiment are marked by a square pulse in the voltage. In our experiments the rising edge of the pulse is usually aligned with the relevant event in the experiment (say stimulus onset). We then use a separate logfile of the experiment to match the triggers to different conditions and so on. \nThis specific dataset should have 90 triggers because the corresponding experimental block had 90 trials and because the nexstim software counted 90 triggers during recording. \nHope my answers are of some help. Please ask if anything is still blurry. \n\nBest, \nRenate"
