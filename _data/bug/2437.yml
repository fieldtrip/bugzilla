          Created attachment 582
          opening demo

          There is a thresholded n-dimensional binary map involved in all clustering routines, derived from comparing the computed statistic to the specified critical threshold.

          For sensor-level time/frequency/channel clustering we have the parameter cfg.minnbchan, which removes samples from this binary map in case the time/frequency clusters are connected by a number of channels less than the value of cfg.minnbchan. This makes sense because from physiological prior info we can expect 'real' clusters to be connected by more than just a narrow bridge of samples.

          I recall several posts on the mailing list from people asking about a similar cfg.minnbtim or cfg.minnbfreq parameter, separating clusters that are connected by a narrow bridge in the time or freq dimension. This would also make sense, I think. However, this is not possible to implement in the same way as cfg.minnbchan, as throughout findcluster() the time/freq dimension is treated as a regular 2D matrix (which is good, because then labelling of the clusters is very fast through spm_bwlabel).

          Similarly, I just ran into this issue when doing source statistics: I observed a big cluster consisting of two physiologically plausible 'blobs' connected by a physiologically highly implausible narrow bridge of samples (in 3D the probability of getting such a wacky bridge is of course much higher than in 2D). The clustering routine of course treated this cluster as one, making the results hard to interpret.

          After a short amount of Googling I found some stuff about morphological binary image processing. This is a useful link: http://www.johnloomis.org/ece563/notes/BinaryImages/morph/morph.html and this one is specific to Matlab: http://www.mathworks.nl/help/images/morphology-fundamentals-dilation-and-erosion.html . The process of 'opening' (an erosion followed by a dilation) seems to do exactly what I would want here: destroy narrow bridges, retain only major features of the image. See the attachment for a demonstration of what it does on a 2D thing I drew:

            subplot(2,1,1);
            imagesc(im);
            colormap gray;
            title('original');
            subplot(2,1,2);
            imagesc(imopen(im, ones(3,3)));
            colormap gray;
            title('opened');

          I think it would be a good idea to add this functionality to clusterstat. At least first we might implement it in the case of source statistics, as it is very straightforward there, just add a call to imopen() before doing the labelling of clusters. For time/freq clustering I'm not sure how this would combine with the handling of neighbouring channels (although it might be very simple in that case, too).

          Does anyone see a problem with me implementing this? Maybe we could discuss how to proceed during the meeting.

          From the top of my head: I think there is a minnbchan option somewhere to prevent narrow bridges (in channel-dimension?)

          imopen/imclose/imerode/imdilate all are related to this. There is also something with a "structural element" that one can specify for some of the image toolbox operations.

          I suggest to look into how it is presently done for channels (somewhere in the code of Eric), and make it consistent.

        thetext: Took a vote at FT meeting, people seem in favour. Will implement (after researching what would be the proper structuring element for an n-d opening operation).
