          Multitapering rotates the phases relative to the LFP.
          We should explicitly correct for this rotation.

          it is of primary importance to have the (desired and therefore hopefully implemented) phase correctly defined. Does a phase of 0 degrees mean that the spike is at the peak of the oscillation? If the phase is -45 degrees, does that mean that the spike is prior to, or after the peak?

          This definition should be available to the users in the documentation of the function.

          This is documented in the help of the spiketriggeredspectrum function.

          A phase of zero corresponds to the peak of the oscillation.
          A phase of 180 degree corresponds to the through of the oscillation.
          A movement in the counterclockwise direction corresponds to later phases.

          good that it is already there!

          I suggest to rephrase it into

          A phase of zero corresponds to the spike being on the peak of the LFP oscillation.
          A phase of 180 degree corresponds to the spike being in the through of the oscillation.
          A phase of 45 degrees corresponds to the spike being just (before/after?) the peak in the LFP.

          ok I have taken over these exact sentences in put them in the help of the main spiketriggeredspectrum and _fft and _convol implementation

          In my view the phase rotation of multitapering can be determined by passing a cosine signal centered around the spike and determining the phase offset induced, as the system is linear. Agree?

          Agreed.

          Added the taper correction for ft_spiketriggeredspectrum_convol.m

          I've tested the phase distortion induced and it's quite small in the tested
          cases (0.01 rad), and indeed zero for a symmetric taper.

          Needs to be added to ft_spiketriggeredspectrum_fft.m as well

          In the help on the definition the question mark needs to be removed and only before or after should be stated. Imagine explaining a picture with a sine wave, and three spikes sitting on top of it. Where would the 45 degree spike be?

The convention described here is the same as I implemented in specestmtm_convol, peak at 0, going counterclockwise \n\nAdded JM:\nJM, shall we do this phase rotation correction for mtmconvol as well?

          Can I ask what is the convention enforcement?

          For the crsspctrm output it doesn not matter of course because you rotate both fourierspctra in the same fashion, but for the fourierspctra it does.

          This convention ensures zero phase for a cosine input, but I'd think it doesn't take care of the rotation.
