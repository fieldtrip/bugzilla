          personally, I need this since I got a dataset of patients with bandages around their head, which prevents us from putting electrodes at some positions
          whether this is an advisable thing to do or not can be argued about

          Related, see bug 634 - using spherical spline interpolation, reconstructing missing channels makes more sense

          Hey Boris,

          I could provide a test script. On the other hand, I already got mail from two people for which this did not work as they expected (which is more related to the fact that they were hacking this functionality into the code anyway, already). I'm gonna bring this up on Wednesday

          I extended the testscript for ft_channelrepair by testing for missing channel and borrowing data from bug 941. Sanity checks:
          for tr=1:numel(data_eeg_interp.trial)
            tmp = repmat(data_eeg_interp.trial{tr}(end, :), 4, 1);
            if all(tmp < data_eeg_interp.trial{tr}(cfg.neighbours, :)) | ...
                all(tmp > data_eeg_interp.trial{tr}(cfg.neighbours, :))
              error(['The average is not in between its channel neighbours at for trial ' num2str(tr)]);
            elseif ~all(data_eeg_interp.trial{tr}(end, :) == data_eeg_repaired.trial{tr}(25, :))
              error('The reconstruction of the same channel differs when being treated as a missing channel compared to a bad channel');
            else
              fprintf('trial %i is fine\n', tr);
            end
          end
