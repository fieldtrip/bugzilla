          In principle I'd say that we don't support MATLAB versions older than 5 years. See
          http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/code_guidelines#ensure_that_it_runs_on_older_matlab_versions

          However, this one is easy to avoid. See also bug 541. I will fix it.

          There might be other stuff however that won't work with 2007a (a.k.a. version 7.4) and older.

          (In reply to comment #1)
          Thanks.
          MATLAB R2007a might be a supported version for SPM12:

          Are you aware of other incompatibilities of FT with this version of MATLAB?

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #3)\n\nnothing specifically. \n\nWe have just been discussing yesterday that it would be good to try to compile a table with columns for OS versions (win/linux/osx times 32/64) and rows for matlab version (about 5 years into the past). For each cell in the table it would be nice to know which of the test scripts fail. This would have to be compiled once for a specific fieldtrip revision."
