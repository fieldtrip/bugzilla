          I implemented the first post-commit-gitsync script last week. It worked for me, but today I see that there is a commit from Jan-Mathijs on svn which is not synched to github. I suspect there to be a permission problem.

          I sudo'ed to jansch on the svn server and tried it:


          jansch@dccn-l017:/home/svnroot/fieldtrip/hooks
          420 $ ./post-commit-gitsync /home/svnroot/fieldtrip 8289

          REV=8289
          fatal: Unable to create '/home/svnroot/fieldtrip/hooks/gitsync/fieldtrip-github-svn/.git/index.lock': Permission denied

          I fixed the permission on the .git directory and tried again.

          It seems to run fine on the svn server, but there appears to be a connection error. I simply ran it once more
