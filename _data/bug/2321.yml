          Hi Craig,
          Thanks for noticing. Mtmwelch was deprecated a long time ago, but I hadn't noticed this reference in the documentation. Notice is removed.

        thetext: "The main reason is that it was hardly ever used. \nAnother reason was that it can be done relatively simply by averaging over a selection of time-points that come as output of method = 'mtmconvol', or by repeatedly calling method = 'mtmfft'."
