          ft_timelockgrandaverage fails under the following conditions:

          1. cfg.parameter = 'avg';

          2. input is from ft_timelockanalysis with cfg.keeptrials = 'yes';

          in this case, line 167 results in an error:

          "Index exceeds matrix dimensions."

          because the functions expects a 3dim field but .avg is only 2dim.

          it would be possible to add something like strcmp(cfg.parameter, 'avg') in that area and handle that case differently. but this is just a suggestion....

          best,
          thomas
