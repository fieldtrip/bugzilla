          hi,

          I can't find where some cfg options are documented when ft_sourceanalysis with method 'mne' is used.
          We use cfg.mne.scalesourcecov='yes' and cfg.mne.prewhiten='yes', but I can not find any of these in the help of ft_sourceanalysis or minimumnormestimate.

        thetext: "(In reply to comment #1)\nHey Jan-Mathijs,\n\nI see the options documented in minimumnormestimate, but how could someone realize she/he should look at the documentation of this specific function if he/she is using ft_sourceanalysis with cfg.method='mne'. \n\nI guess that ft_sourceanalysis could work in the same way as ft_prepare_headmodel is working now, meaning that people could check the documentation of the specific method for further details of the possible configuration options. But this should be true for the other source-analysis methods as well then. And maybe we could discuss this at the next FT meeting. Could we re-open this bug or should I create a new one?\n\nLilla"

          hmmm, I did not think of this. I'd suggest to re-open.
