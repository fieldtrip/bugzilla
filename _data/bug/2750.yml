          Thanks for reporting the specific bug.

          There have been significant changes in the graphics in matlab2014b, which we are aware of. It will take time to resolve these issues. I hope that you can revert to matlab2014a for the time being.

          See also bug 2461.

          this issue is fixed now, as I fixed bug 2296
          (now refers to as soon as the new fieldtrip version is available on the ftp server)
