          In the context of bug1441, Robert and I discussed the installation of OpenMEEG. We were both expecting that $FT/external/openmeeg would contain all the files needed to use OpenMEEG, but it appears that a separate install of OpenMEEG is necessary.

          Is there a good reason not to? I checked the file sizes, and the current release is well below 10 MB (compressed)

          @Robert, could you indicate which project in $FT/external we could use as an example for wrapping binary executables on different platforms?

          (In reply to comment #0)
          Hi,
          I checked the forge site of OpenMEEG:
          https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=435

          and it looks like the whole set of executables is now well above 10MB. Are we really sure we want to have it packaged in the FT release? I would say that it makes more sense to add a warning in ft_hastoolbox('openmeeg') which points out to the user which wiki page to look at, in order to proceed to the manual installation.

          What do you think?

          Best,
          Cristiano

          Sounds like a valid option to me as well. But I got the feeling that it is more in the philosophy of FieldTrip to provide the user the service of the availability of a comprehensive set of tools; so perhaps it should be included after all.

          What do you think Robert?

        thetext: "Ideally we would indeed package it in the lease zit, but 10 mb or more per platform (there are three) gets quite heavy. Idem for simbio and fns.\n\nBut I think we should, besides pointing to the official release site, provide our own tested version, e.g. as zip from our own FTP. The zip content should be checked and should be known to work. Ideally it is the same as the official release, but if needed we can repackage for easier deployment.\n\nE.g.\n\nftp.fcdonders.nl/pub/fieldtrip/external/openmeeg/windows.zip\nftp.fcdonders.nl/pub/fieldtrip/external/openmeeg/linux.zip\nftp.fcdonders.nl/pub/fieldtrip/external/openmeeg/osx.zip\n\nAnd idem for fns, simbio and even perhaps for dipoli. If thre is a consistent check on the binary executable being present at the expected locatio, \nthere can also be a consistent information message to the users with download and install instructions for the executables.\n\nThe wrapper/glue code should remain in the regular fieldtrip.zip release."

        thetext: Ok, that sounds like a nice compromise. I wonder though where these wrappers should be maintained? If it is in the main SVN, it should be excluded from the daily FieldTrip release.

        thetext: installation instructions are provided at http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/faq/how_can_i_use_openmeeg_for_forward_modelling which is the first hit in google if I search for "fieldtrip openmeeg". I don't think we can make it much easier. Providing binaries for all platform inside the fieldtrip zip file does not sound like a good plan to me.
