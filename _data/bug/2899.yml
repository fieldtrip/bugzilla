          as discussed following last M/EEG meeting.

          The idea is to start from page 123 in the pdf below - which has the layouts for all the caps: http://ganesha.uoregon.edu/images/8/8c/Gsn_013107.pdf

          Once all locations have been digitised from the bitmaps and given the correct name, the next step is to make outlines and masks.

          I will attach here on the bugzilla page a first attempt to sketch an outline in Adobe Illustrator (which I hope you also have on your PC). In this one it is easy to scale the head shape and move it around until it is "visually pleasing". One a useful size and shape is clear, you can then take the head shape we already have in the default layouts and scale+shift it to get it approximately the same as in AI.

          Note that my attempt is only version 1. You know the nets better than I do, so you should take the head shapes in the AI file and update them to your liking. It could well be that I made the heads too large compared to the electrode nets.

          The mask is used for interpolating, and could be a single circle that extends outside the outline (i.e. goes below the nose and ears), as sometimes used in EEGLAB like here http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/comp252.jpg

          Please let me know if you have questions.

        thetext: we will also need a consistent naming scheme that corresponds to the EGI documentation. We should revise the naming scheme for the SFP files as well, so that it is clear which SFP file corresponds to which layout (and page in the PDF documentation).

          I tried to look at Robert's ai and pdf files but they are no longer on dropbox.  Anna's files are not accessible to me.
