          I noticed the following test scripts that fail to run, i.e. they do not produce PASSED or FAILED but are somehow aborted prior to completion. Why is that?

          test_ft_datatype_source
          test_ft_prepare_headmodel

          1) test_bug1913 might be because of mex file incompatibility, it reads eeprobe data. The output log contains a matlab crash report.

          2) test_ft_datatype_source is because it takes longer than the specified WALLTIME.

          3) test_ft_prepare_headmodel is unclear

          4) test_old_trialdef has an issue with xunit

          5) test_tutorial_beamformer is unclear

          6) test_tutorial_beamformingextended20131122 is unclear

          7) test_tutorial_eventrelatedstatistics has an issue with xunit

          8) test_tutorial_fem is unclear

          The "unclear" ones just don't seem to start up. I can see that MATLAB starts, that my startup.m gets parsed, and then nothing happens. This seems a torque cluster issue, ant not something we can solve.

          note that this indicates a problem with the eeprobe mex files. Not something I want to solve here and now.
