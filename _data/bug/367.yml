          To be more specific, the error occurs at line 119 of ft_prepare_sourcemodel where this line of code is problematic:

          ft_filetype(cfg.headshape, blahblah)

          turns out that cfg.headshape is empty. The field does exist because it is created in the deault settings of ft_megrealign, namely:

          cfg.headshape = [];


          I'm not familiar using ft_megrealign and don't know what the purpose of cfg.headshape is in this matter.

          Should the field be removed or is an extra check in ft_prepare_sourcemodel necessary (whether cfg.headshape is not empty) to avoid problems with the calls to ft_filetype and fileparts?
