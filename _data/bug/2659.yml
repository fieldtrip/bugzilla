          I have the following timelock structure, generated with cfg.keeptrials = 'yes':

          avg: [1x1601 double]
          var: [1x1601 double]
          time: [1x1601 double]
          dof: [1x1601 double]
          label: {'TETFP10'}
          trial: [65x1x1601 double]
          dimord: 'rpt_chan_time'
          cov: [65x1 double]
          trialinfo: [65x1 double]
          cfg: [1x1 struct]

          Note the dimord for 'avg' is 'chan_time' but for 'trial' it is 'rpt_chan_time'. When I pass these timelocks structures into ft_timelockgrandaverage (cfg.method='across') then I get the following error:

          Index exceeds matrix dimensions.

          Error in ft_timelockgrandaverage (line 167)
                varargin{i}.(cfg.parameter) = varargin{i}.(cfg.parameter)(:,chansel,timesel);

          The problems is of course that ft_timelockgrandaverage looks at the dimord field which is only valid for 'trials' but the parameter being averaged is 'avg'. ft_timelockgrandaverage shouldn't be relying on the dimord field I think...

          OK, I think the comment in this related bug probably answers this bug too, that this is a known weakness of having only 1 dimord field and this will be a high-impact change to fix properly and you don't want to do this with a smaller hack to change dimord to take into account the cfg.parameter field?
