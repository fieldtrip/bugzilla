        thetext: we talked about this in one of the FT meetings. I just realized that e.g. ft_prepare_headmodel does not support loading data from disk, some other use ft_preamble loadvar data, etc.

          My idea here would be that only FT main functions that take a regular data structure (raw, comp, timelock) as input should support cfg.inputfile. We don't want to promote arbitrary inputs (such as geom in ft_prepare_headmodel, or the input args for ft_stratify) to formal fieldtrip data structures.

          This leaves open the question: what are currently the format FT data structures, besides the obvious ones?

          Changed the status of bugs without a specific owner to UNCONFIRMED. I'll try to replicate these bugs (potentially involving the submitter), and change confirmed bugs to NEW.

          Explanation from RO during bug-binge. This is a low priority enhancement, but not un-important. There are plans to move towards compiled QSUB, so that is can run without MATLAB. *For this, file handling is required.* If compiled MATLAB takes off, a compiled FieldTrip might even be viable, which would process cfg files.

          Robert suggested to assign this bug to JM, which I do now.

          I don't think that anything specific needs to be done about this at the moment.
          Compiled FieldTrip works quite well and is currently up-and-running for the human connectome project.
          I suggest to reopen once we encounter issues in this respect.

          (In reply to Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen from comment #6)

          agreed. Seems to work fine for the moment, also because of the relative consistent use of preambles.
