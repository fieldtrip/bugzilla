          i.e. comparing the file on disk they are not identical.

          This also goes for test_ft_timelockanalysis (while the raw data structure is loaded from disk, so the input should be identical for the comparison)

          there seems to be a feature in the plexon data in that the first trial contains NaNs for some of the channels (but not in all time points).
          replacing the isequal in the testscript with isequalwithequalnans fixes the crash. Outputs are identical upon this comparison
