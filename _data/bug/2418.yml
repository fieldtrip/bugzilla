          There seems to be a bug in ft_senstype.
          Even if my data.label has names without spaces, it always returns 'neuromag306', instead of 'neuromag306alt'. Because of that line 103 and 104 in ft_combineplanar returns empty matrices.

          Thanks,

          it can be reproduced with

          lab = ft_senslabel('neuromag306alt')
          lab = lab(:);
          ft_senstype(lab)

          which returns "neuromag306".

          (In reply to Gianpaolo Demarchi from comment #4)

          thanks for the test data. I can confirm your report with

          >> ft_senstype(testdata_short)
          ans =
          neuromag306

          >> ft_senstype(testdata_short.label)
          ans =
          neuromag306alt

          >> ft_senstype(testdata_short.grad)
          ans =
          neuromag306

          >> ft_senstype(testdata_short.grad.label)
          ans =
          neuromag306alt

          Case 1 and 3 are explained by testdata_short.grad having the type specified as neuromag306 (that was added incorrectly when it was created by you with the previous incorrect FT version).

          If I do

          >> testdata_short.grad = rmfield(testdata_short.grad, 'type');

          then

          >> ft_senstype(testdata_short)
          ans =
          neuromag306alt

          >> ft_senstype(testdata_short.label)
          ans =
          neuromag306alt

          >> ft_senstype(testdata_short.grad)
          ans =
          neuromag306alt

          >> ft_senstype(testdata_short.grad.label)
          ans =
          neuromag306alt

          all types are correct. So the error is in the data structure (because FT was wrong when the data structure was made) and not in the present code any more.

          ohh... this neuromag306 versus neuromag306alt is a mess. Why do we have the two types in the code? I can understand that we need it for the template files (layout and neighbours), but the code would be much cleaner without it.

What's the real need of having the two versions, even if present in the fiff pipeline, since also the combined channels are the same, spaces apart ... ?!"

Subsequently, if FT looks at the grad, it sees type=neuromag306. If FT looks at only the labels, it decides it is neuromag306alt.\n\nThroughout the code I don't see any important use of neuromag306alt, it is only there to allow the channel list from ft_senslabel to have the space or not. I think that there should only be one type, and that it should work with or without spaces. \n\nNote about stripping the spaces: the spaces are there (or not) in the fif file. Some neuromag systems have been configured to have spaces, some do not have spaces. FT should not change the channel names, so stripping the spaces is not a good idea. But FT should simply not care whether there is a space or not."
