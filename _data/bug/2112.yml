        thetext: "for my gsn128 no template is present. And I was also thinking, why not also making  ft_prepare_neighbours accept and elec file as template. So for instance\n\ncfg.template = 'GSN-HydroCel-128.sfp';\nthen it calls \nelec = ft_read_sens('GSN-HydroCel-128.sfp');\ndata.elec   = elec;\ncfg         = [];\ncfg.method  = 'distance';\nneighbours  = ft_prepare_neighbours(cfg, data);\n\nand use neigbours as the template. It's a bit obscure now, if the template for the user is not present what the templates are ans what's in it."

          The ft_prepare_neighbours documentation states

          % The EEG or MEG sensor positions can be present in the data or can be specified as
          %   cfg.elec          = structure with electrode positions, see FT_DATATYPE_SENS
          %   cfg.grad          = structure with gradiometer definition, see FT_DATATYPE_SENS
          %   cfg.elecfile      = name of file containing the electrode positions, see FT_READ_SENS
          %   cfg.gradfile      = name of file containing the gradiometer definition, see FT_READ_SENS

          so I would expect this to be implemented already. Could you check whether it works for you?

        thetext: "Yes, you're right, it works with calling: \n\nelec        = ft_read_sens('GSN-HydroCel-129.sfp');\ncfg         = [];\ncfg.elec    = elec;\ncfg.method  = 'distance';\nneighbours  = ft_prepare_neighbours(cfg);\n\nI was just confused by the option cfg.template. This option and having all these pre-made templates now seems so redundant to me, since the above works as well. Well, maybe there is some other logic behind the templates and having cfg.template as an option. Anyways, bug solved."
