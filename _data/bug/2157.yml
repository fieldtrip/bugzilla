          I am not sure how svn works, but up to now my fieldtrip has been around 1 GB , Yesterday during svn update it downloaded additional files for some time and then it was 2.3 GB.

          Also I have checked out fieldtrip in another computer and I also ran svn update.
          There the size is 1.1 GB !!!

          I dont understand why I get 2 different repository sizes.

          Anyone any idea?

          And if you now svn update on the original PC? If it still isn't fixed, it sounds like a corrupt working copy to me. I would recommend deleting the working copy and checking out completely new.

          This does not seem like a bug to me :) Closing for now. Feel free to reopen if you have indications that this is a fieldtrip problem.

          could you check what happens when you checkout other SVN repositories on those three machines?

        thetext: "I checked out Octave and the size is again different in all three machines\nwhen is computed through the du -hs command.\nI compared with du -hs and with ls -l the size of some files and while with ls -l the files have the same size, with du -hs the sizes are different.\nI think the difference has to do that the output of du -hs depends on the cylinder size which can be different from system to system.\nAnyway I counted the number of files/subdirectories in all three machines with\n \ndu -k|wc -l\n\nand in all three machines the number was the same.\nIt seems that the different sizes are only due to the different cylinder sizes and the du command. No problem eith Fieldrtip. Thank you and sorry for your time.\n\nThank you Giorgos"
